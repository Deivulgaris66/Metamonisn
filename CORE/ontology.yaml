# ================= CATEGORIES =================
categories:
  - id: "monos"
    category_type: "ontology"
    term: "Monos"
    
    definition: |
      The ontological continuum of reality as continuous, processual differentiation.
      No discrete entities or fixed relations exist at this level—only the perpetual
      process of distinction-making (diff). Fixation (fix) is ontologically impossible.
    
    derived_from: "axiom_ban_of_absolute_identity"
    
    characteristics:
      - "Continuous (non-discrete)"
      - "Process-oriented"
      - "diff operations fundamental"
      - "fix operations ontologically impossible"
    
    notes: |
      Monos enforces the prohibition of absolute identity directly.
      No entity can satisfy absolute self-identity x ≡ x in Monos.
      Any state perpetually differs from itself: x(t₁) ≠ x(t₂).
      Complete fixation fix(x) = x cannot be ontologically instantiated.

  - id: "logos"
    category_type: "epistemology"
    term: "Logos"
    
    definition: |
      The epistemological space of models, theories, and fixed representations.
      Discrete entities and stable relations can exist through fix operations.
      Identity fix(x) = x is permissible, enabling formal modeling and repeatability.
    
    derived_from: "axiom_ban_of_absolute_identity"
    
    characteristics:
      - "Discrete (allows fixed entities)"
      - "Model-oriented"
      - "fix operations permitted"
      - "Represents Monos, never identical to it"
    
    notes: |
      Logos is epistemologically distinct from but structurally isomorphic to Monos.
      All scientific theories and measurements operate in Logos.
      Logos emerges from selective fixation of aspects of Monos.

# ================= PRINCIPLES =================
principles:
  - id: "principle_identity_prohibition_in_monos"
    
    statement: |
      Monos cannot instantiate absolute identity. Any actual process necessarily
      possesses distinctions and cannot be reduced to complete self-sameness.
    
    derived_from: "CORE/axioms.yaml#axiom_ban_of_absolute_identity"
    
    notes: "Direct consequence of the foundational axiom."

  - id: "principle_identity_admissibility_in_logos"
    
    statement: |
      Logos admits operational identity. Objects and relations can be fixed,
      repeated, and modeled as stable entities.
    
    derived_from: "CORE/operators.yaml#fix"
    
    notes: |
      This enables formal modeling, prediction, and operational stability.
      Identity in Logos is epistemic (model-based), not ontological.

  - id: "principle_isomorphism_monos_logos"
    
    statement: |
      Monos and Logos are structurally isomorphic through diff and fix operations,
      but reside in distinct ontological/epistemological categories.
    
    derived_from: 
      - "CORE/operators.yaml#diff"
      - "CORE/operators.yaml#fix"
    
    notes: |
      Isomorphism allows models (Logos) to reference reality (Monos) without
      claiming identity with it. This prevents ontological reduction.

  - id: "principle_epistemic_cycle"
    
    statement: |
      The operational cycle of knowledge:
      1. Monos: continuous process with unfixable aspects
      2. Epistemic selection: choosing aspects for modeling
      3. Logos: fixation into stable models
      4. Discovery: models reveal previously unmodeled aspects of Monos
    
    derived_from: 
      - "CORE/ontology.yaml#categories/monos"
      - "CORE/ontology.yaml#categories/logos"
      - "CORE/operators.yaml#diff"
      - "CORE/operators.yaml#fix"
    
    notes: |
      This is an epistemic cycle, not ontological generation.
      Monos ontologically precedes Logos. The cycle describes how scientific
      knowledge iteratively refines models without exhausting reality.
