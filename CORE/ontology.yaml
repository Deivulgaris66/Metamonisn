# ================= CATEGORIES =================
categories:
  - id: "monos"
    category_type: "ontology"
    term: "Monos"
    
    symbolic_representability: false
    
    definition: |
      The ontological continuum of reality as continuous, processual differentiation.
      No discrete entities or fixed relations exist at this level—only the perpetual
      process of distinction-making (diff). Fixation (fix) is ontologically impossible.
      
      Monos is where the prohibition actively operates: momentum is conserved,
      dissipation is necessary, and stasis is impossible.
    
    derived_from: "axiom_ban_of_absolute_identity"
    
    characteristics:
      - "Continuous (non-discrete)"
      - "Process-oriented"
      - "Non-symbolic (cannot be directly represented)"
      - "diff operations fundamental"
      - "dissipate operations necessary"
      - "fix operations ontologically impossible"
      - "Momentum is conserved"
    
    notes: |
      Monos enforces the prohibition of absolute identity directly.
      No entity can satisfy absolute self-identity x ≡ x in Monos.
      Any state perpetually differs from itself: x(t₁) ≠ x(t₂).
      Complete fixation fix(x) = x cannot be ontologically instantiated.
      
      CRITICAL: Monos is non-symbolic. All symbols, models, equations, and
      formal representations belong to Logos. Attempting to 'directly model'
      Monos is a category error.
      
      Physical manifestation: all conservation laws operate at this level.

  - id: "logos"
    category_type: "epistemology"
    term: "Logos"
    
    symbolic_representability: true
    
    definition: |
      The epistemological space of models, theories, and fixed representations.
      Discrete entities and stable relations can exist through fix operations.
      Identity fix(x) = x is permissible, enabling formal modeling and repeatability.
      
      Logos is where the prohibition is suspended for epistemic purposes:
      models can treat systems as 'closed' and 'stable' for analysis.
    
    derived_from: "axiom_ban_of_absolute_identity"
    
    characteristics:
      - "Discrete (allows fixed entities)"
      - "Model-oriented"
      - "Symbolic (formal representations possible)"
      - "fix operations permitted"
      - "Represents Monos, never identical to it"
      - "Idealized conservation laws (closed systems)"
    
    notes: |
      Logos is epistemologically distinct from but structurally isomorphic to Monos.
      All scientific theories and measurements operate in Logos.
      Logos emerges from selective fixation of aspects of Monos.
      
      Logos is the domain of symbols, language, mathematics, and formal logic.
      All communication (including this text) occurs in Logos.
      
      Physical manifestation: idealized models (frictionless planes, 
      perfectly elastic collisions, etc.) exist only in Logos.

# ================= PRINCIPLES =================
principles:
  - id: "principle_CMI_structure"
    short_name: "КМИ Principle"
    full_name: "Conflict-Momentum-Impulse Principle"
    principle_type: "ontological"
    
    statement: |
      Reality is structured as a triadic process (КМИ):
      1. Prohibition (Конфликт): Absolute identity is ontologically impossible
      2. Momentum (Момент-Импульс): Conserved necessity of differentiation (p = mv)
      3. Force (enforcement): Active mechanism maintaining momentum (F = dp/dt)
      
      This triadic structure generates all physical laws and processes.

    implications:
      - "Newton's laws derive from КМИ structure"
      - "Conservation laws express the prohibition"
      - "Second Law of Thermodynamics follows from dissipation necessity"
      - "Arrow of time results from irreversible dissipation"
    
    historical_note: |
      КМИ (Конфликт-Момент-Импульс) was the original formulation
      of the Metamonism framework. The English term "Momentum" elegantly unifies
      both Момент (moment/instant) and Импульс (impulse/thrust), capturing
      the conserved, processual nature of reality.

  - id: "principle_motion_as_necessity"
    principle_type: "ontological"
    
    statement: |
      Motion, change, and process are not contingent facts requiring explanation.
      They are ontological necessities enforced by the prohibition of absolute identity.
      Stasis, not motion, requires special explanation (fix operations in Logos).
      
      The prohibition generates momentum, which cannot vanish: reality 'cannot stop.'
    
    derived_from: "CORE/axioms.yaml#axiom_ban_of_absolute_identity"
    
    implications:
      - "Quantum vacuum cannot be empty (zero-point fluctuations necessary)"
      - "Time cannot 'stop' (temporal flow is necessary)"
      - "Entropy must increase (dissipation is enforced)"
      - "Universe cannot be static (expansion is necessary)"
      - "Absolute zero is unreachable (motion cannot cease)"
    
    notes: |
      This reverses the classical ontological assumption that rest is the
      natural state and motion requires causes. In Metamonism, motion IS
      the natural state, enforced by the prohibition. Rest (fix) is only
      possible in models (Logos), not in reality (Monos).

  - id: "principle_ontological_dissipation"
    principle_type: "ontological"
    
    statement: |
      The prohibition of absolute identity necessitates continuous dissipation.
      Any emergent fixation in Monos must be negated through energy dispersal
      to maintain ontological compliance with the prohibition.
      
      Dissipation is the energy cost of maintaining momentum against resistance.
      It manifests physically as entropy increase and temporal irreversibility.
    
    derived_from: "CORE/axioms.yaml#axiom_ban_of_absolute_identity"
    
    relationship_to_noether_theorem: |
      Noether's theorem establishes: conservation laws ↔ symmetries
      
      In Metamonism:
      - Conservation of momentum → time translation symmetry (КМИ prohibition)
      - Dissipation (ΔS > 0) → breaks time-reversal symmetry
      
      Resolution:
      - Momentum is conserved (symmetry) because prohibition is time-invariant
      - BUT dissipation enforces temporal asymmetry (arrow of time)
      - Time has direction BECAUSE dissipation is ontologically necessary
      
      This reconciles:
      - Time-symmetric conservation laws (Noether)
      - Time-asymmetric thermodynamics (Second Law)
      
      via КМИ structure: prohibition (symmetric) → enforcement (asymmetric)
    
    relationship_to_physics: |
      The Second Law of Thermodynamics (ΔS ≥ 0) is not a separate physical law
      but an ontological necessity. Dissipation is the 'signature' of the
      prohibition's active enforcement.
      
      Physical chain:
      1. Prohibition generates momentum (p conserved)
      2. Momentum requires force to maintain (F = dp/dt)
      3. Force requires work/energy (E = ∫F·dx)
      4. Energy expenditure produces entropy (ΔS > 0)
      5. Entropy increase = dissipation = irreversibility = arrow of time
    
    notes: |
      Dissipation is not 'waste' but ontological necessity. It ensures
      that reality cannot 'freeze' into absolute identity. Without dissipation,
      the prohibition would be violated.

  - id: "principle_identity_prohibition_in_monos"
    principle_type: "ontological"
    
    statement: |
      Monos cannot instantiate absolute identity. Any actual process necessarily
      possesses distinctions and cannot be reduced to complete self-sameness.
    
    derived_from: "CORE/axioms.yaml#axiom_ban_of_absolute_identity"
    
    notes: "Direct consequence of the foundational axiom."

  - id: "principle_identity_admissibility_in_logos"
    principle_type: "epistemic"
    
    statement: |
      Logos admits operational identity. Objects and relations can be fixed,
      repeated, and modeled as stable entities.
    
    derived_from: "CORE/operators.yaml#fix"
    
    notes: |
      This enables formal modeling, prediction, and operational stability.
      Identity in Logos is epistemic (model-based), not ontological.

  - id: "principle_isomorphism_monos_logos"
    principle_type: "bridge"
    
    statement: |
      Monos and Logos are structurally isomorphic through diff, dissipate, and fix operations,
      but reside in distinct ontological/epistemological categories.
    
    derived_from: 
      - "CORE/operators.yaml#diff"
      - "CORE/operators.yaml#dissipate"
      - "CORE/operators.yaml#fix"
    
    notes: |
      Isomorphism allows models (Logos) to reference reality (Monos) without
      claiming identity with it. This prevents ontological reduction.

  - id: "principle_epistemic_cycle"
    principle_type: "bridge"
    
    statement: |
      The operational cycle of knowledge:
      1. Monos: continuous process with unfixable aspects
      2. Epistemic selection: choosing aspects for modeling
      3. Logos: fixation into stable models
      4. Discovery: models reveal previously unmodeled aspects of Monos
    
    derived_from: 
      - "CORE/ontology.yaml#categories/monos"
      - "CORE/ontology.yaml#categories/logos"
      - "CORE/operators.yaml#diff"
      - "CORE/operators.yaml#dissipate"
      - "CORE/operators.yaml#fix"
    
    notes: |
      This is an epistemic cycle, not ontological generation.
      Monos ontologically precedes Logos. The cycle describes how scientific
      knowledge iteratively refines models without exhausting reality.
