# CORE/01_ontology.yaml
# Version: 1.1
# Purpose: Primary ontological and epistemological consequences derived from the Axiom of Actuality's Ban of Identity.
# Categories, operators, and principles are strictly forced by the axiom.

# ================= CATEGORIES =================
categories:
  - id: "monos"
    category_type: "ontology"
    term: "Monos"
    definition: |
      Continuum of actualized processes. Only states exist; no entities or relations.
      Diff is fundamental; fix is impossible. Represents reality as irreducible, continuous process.
    derived_from: "axiom_actuality_ban_of_identity"
    notes: |
      Monos enforces the prohibition of absolute identity directly.
      Diff(x, x) ≠ 0. Complete fixation is impossible. Analytical limit: only partial epistemic access.

  - id: "logos"
    category_type: "epistemology"
    term: "Logos"
    definition: |
      Space of models and formalizations. Entities and relations exist; fixation is possible and required.
      Diff(x, x) = 0; fix(x) = x. Provides operational stability and repeatability.
    derived_from: "axiom_actuality_ban_of_identity"
    notes: |
      Logos is isomorphic to Monos by operations (diff, fix), but epistemologically distinct.
      Operational space of identity, repetition, and formal abstraction. Represents our capacity to model reality.

# ================= OPERATORS =================
operators:
  - id: "operator_diff"
    symbol: "diff"
    definition: "Fundamental operation of differentiation producing distinction."
    applicable_to:
      - "monos"
    derived_from: "axiom_actuality_ban_of_identity"
    notes: "Diff(x, x) ≠ 0 in Monos; reveals structural necessity of distinction."

  - id: "operator_fix"
    symbol: "fix"
    definition: "Operation of fixation, rendering distinctions explicit and entities identifiable."
    applicable_to:
      - "logos"
    derived_from: ["axiom_actuality_ban_of_identity", "operator_diff"]
    notes: "Fix(x) is only admissible in Logos. Makes aspects of Monos operationally accessible."

# ================= PRINCIPLES =================
principles:
  - id: "principle_identity_violation_in_monos"
    statement: "Monos cannot admit absolute identity; any actualized state inherently violates identity."
    derived_from: "axiom_actuality_ban_of_identity"
    notes: "Expresses ontological asymmetry; actualization requires distinction."

  - id: "principle_identity_admissibility_in_logos"
    statement: "Logos admits identity; objects and relations can be fixed, repeated, and modeled."
    derived_from: "axiom_actuality_ban_of_identity"
    notes: "Enables formal modeling, prediction, and operational stability."

  - id: "principle_isomorphism_diff_fix"
    statement: "Monos and Logos are structurally isomorphic through diff and fix operations, but reside in distinct categories."
    derived_from: ["operator_diff", "operator_fix"]
    notes: "Isomorphism allows models to reference reality without equating with it."

  - id: "principle_dynamic_cycle"
    statement: "Operational cycle: new unfixable aspects in Monos → analytical selection → fixation in Logos → emergence of new Monos."
    derived_from: ["monos", "logos", "operator_fix", "operator_diff"]
    notes: "Describes iterative interplay between process (Monos) and model (Logos)."
