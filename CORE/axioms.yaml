axioms:
  - id: "axiom_ban_of_absolute_identity"
    short_name: "Indifference Prohibition Axiom"
    
    statement: |
      Absolute identity (a state without distinctions) is ontologically impossible.
    
    type: "primary_constraint"

    formal_expression: "∄ S : (∀ x,y ∈ S, x ≡ y)"
    
    notes: |
      This is the foundational constraint of the framework.
      It functions as a boundary condition: any valid ontological model must be
      consistent with the impossibility of absolute identity.
      
      This axiom is not empirically falsifiable, but all derivative theories built on this
      foundation must be falsifiable.
    
    implications:
      - "Reality exists only as a process of differentiation."
      - "Any existing entity must possess at least one distinction."
      - "Complete self-identity without context is ontologically empty."
