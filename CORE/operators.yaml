# CORE/operators.yaml
# Version: 1.0 (Skeleton)
# Purpose: Formal description of the basic ontological operators.

# TODO: Formally define the `diff` and `fix` operators, their properties, and interaction.
operators:
  diff:
    symbol: "∇" # Placeholder, to be formalized
    informal_description: "The fundamental process of continuous differentiation."
    # TODO: Add formal definition, domain, co-domain, properties (e.g., non-commutative, non-idempotent).
    notes: "Considered ontologically prior. Generates the potential field of distinctions."

  fix:
    symbol: "!" # Placeholder, to be formalized
    informal_description: "The selection and actualization of a discrete state from a continuum."
    # TODO: Add formal definition, relation to diff (e.g., fix acts upon the output of diff).
    notes: "Makes a specific distinction actual/observable within Logos. Associated with measurement, event, or 'collapse'."

# TODO: Define any other derived or higher-order operators.
