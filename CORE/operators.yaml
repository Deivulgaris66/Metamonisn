# ================= OPERATORS =================

operators:
  - id: "diff"
    symbol: "diff"
    full_name: "Differentiation Operator"
    
    definition: |
      The fundamental operation that produces distinctions from a continuous,
      processual substrate. Ontologically primary and cannot be reduced to
      more basic operations.
      
      diff is the generative aspect of the prohibition: it creates the distinctions
      that prevent absolute identity.
    
    signature: "diff: Process → Distinction"
    
    ontological_status: "primitive"
    
    derived_from: "CORE/axioms.yaml#axiom_ban_of_absolute_identity"
    
    relationship_to_CMI: |
      diff is the operational expression of Momentum (Moment-Impulse):
      - Prohibition generates momentum
      - Momentum manifests as perpetual diff operations
      - diff produces the distinctions that constitute motion
    
    applicable_to:
      - category: "monos"
        category_ref: "CORE/ontology.yaml#categories/monos"
        status: "fundamental"
        notes: |
          In Monos, diff is the only ontologically primitive operation.
          Reality exists as perpetual differentiation.
      
      - category: "logos"
        category_ref: "CORE/ontology.yaml#categories/logos"
        status: "modeled"
        notes: |
          In Logos, diff can be represented and modeled, but is always
          a fixation (approximation) of the Monos-level process.
    
    properties:
      - property: "Non-reversibility"
        description: "diff cannot be 'undone' to restore absolute identity"
        
      - property: "Continuity"
        description: "Operates on processual, non-discrete substrate"
        
      - property: "Context-dependence"
        description: "Distinctions emerge relative to observational/modeling frame"
    
    physical_correspondence:
      ontology: "Production of distinctions"
      physics: "Change in state (velocity, acceleration)"
      notes: "diff generates the 'motion' that momentum necessitates"
    
    formal_constraints:
      - "∀ x ∈ Monos: diff(x) ≠ ∅ (distinctions always exist)"
      - "diff is not invertible: no diff⁻¹ operation exists"

    related_operators:
      - "dissipate"
      - "fix"
    
    notes: |
      diff is not a function in the classical mathematical sense
      (deterministic input → output). It represents the ontological fact
      that reality is inherently and perpetually differentiating.
      
      The prohibition of absolute identity (axiom_ban_of_absolute_identity)
      necessitates diff as the fundamental ontological operation.

  - id: "dissipate"
    symbol: "dissipate"
    short_symbol: "diss"
    full_name: "Dissipation Operator"
    aliases: ["dissipate", "diss"]
    
    definition: |
      The operation that prevents fixation in Monos by continuously dispersing
      any emergent stability. Dissipation is the energetic aspect of the prohibition:
      energy must be expended to maintain momentum and prevent 'freezing' into identity.
      
      dissipate is the enforcement mechanism: it actively destroys any tendency
      toward stasis, ensuring compliance with the prohibition.
    
    signature: "diss: Process → Energy_Dispersal (with ΔS > 0)"
    
    ontological_status: "enforcing"
    
    derived_from: "CORE/axioms.yaml#axiom_ban_of_absolute_identity"
    
    relationship_to_CMI: |
      dissipate is the energetic consequence of the CMI structure:
      
      1. Prohibition (Conflict) → generates conserved momentum
      2. Momentum (Moment-Impulse) → requires force to maintain (F = dp/dt)
      3. Force → requires energy expenditure (W = ∫F·dx)
      4. Energy expenditure → manifests as dissipation
      
      Therefore: Dissipation is the "cost" of enforcing the prohibition.
      It is not optional but ontologically necessary.
    
    applicable_to:
      - category: "monos"
        category_ref: "CORE/ontology.yaml#categories/monos"
        status: "necessary"
        notes: |
          In Monos, dissipation actively operates to prevent any emergent fixation.
          Without dissipation, the prohibition would be violated.
      
      - category: "logos"
        category_ref: "CORE/ontology.yaml#categories/logos"
        status: "modeled_but_not_active"
        notes: |
          In Logos, dissipation can be modeled (e.g., friction, heat loss),
          but is not ontologically active. Models can idealize 'closed systems'
          where dissipation is negligible.
    
    properties:
      - property: "Irreversibility"
        description: "dissipation cannot be reversed; entropy always increases"
        
      - property: "Universality"
        description: "Operates on all processes in Monos without exception"
        
      - property: "Energy-dispersing"
        description: "Converts organized energy into dispersed forms (heat, entropy)"
    
    physical_correspondence:
      ontology: "Dissipation (prevention of fixation)"
      physics: "Energy expenditure and entropy increase"
      mechanism: |
        The prohibition generates momentum (p conserved).
        Momentum requires force to maintain (F = dp/dt).
        Force requires energy (E = ∫F·dx).
        Energy disperses as dissipation (ΔS > 0).
    
    formal_constraints:
      - "dissipate operates only in Monos"
      - "∀ p ∈ Monos: dissipate(p) → ΔS(p) > 0 (entropy always increases)"
      - "dissipate is irreversible (time-asymmetric): no dissipate⁻¹ exists"
      - "In Logos, dissipation is modeled but not ontologically enforced"
    
    physical_manifestations:
      - domain: "thermodynamics"
        instance: "Entropy increase (Second Law: ΔS ≥ 0)"
        explanation: |
          The Second Law is not a separate physical law but a consequence
          of ontological dissipation. Energy dispersal is necessary to
          enforce the prohibition.
        
      - domain: "quantum_mechanics"
        instance: "Decoherence (collapse of superposition)"
        explanation: |
          Quantum dissipation prevents fixation of superposed states.
          Decoherence is the quantum manifestation of the prohibition's enforcement.
        
      - domain: "cosmology"
        instance: "Expansion and cooling of universe"
        explanation: |
          Cosmic dissipation (expansion, cooling, dilution) ensures the universe
          cannot 'freeze' into a static state.
        
      - domain: "time"
        instance: "Arrow of time (temporal irreversibility)"
        explanation: |
          The arrow of time results from irreversible dissipation. Time's
          directionality is the signature of the prohibition's enforcement.
    
    examples:
      - domain: "mechanics"
        instance: "Friction (kinetic energy → heat)"
        
      - domain: "electromagnetism"
        instance: "Radiation (energy dispersal as photons)"
        
      - domain: "biology"
        instance: "Metabolic heat production (chemical energy → heat)"
    
    usage_examples:
      - notation: "diss(p)"
        meaning: "Dissipation of process p"
        
      - notation: "diss(x) → ΔS(x) > 0"
        meaning: "Dissipation of x increases its entropy"
    
    related_operators:
      - "diff"
      - "fix"
    
    relationship_to_diff: |
      diff and dissipate are complementary:
      - diff produces distinctions (generative)
      - dissipate prevents their fixation (dissipative)
      
      Together, they ensure perpetual process in Monos.
    
    notes: |
      Dissipation is not 'waste' but ontological necessity. It is the
      energy signature of the prohibition's active enforcement.
      
      Short form: diss (for brevity in formal expressions)
      
      The impossibility of perpetual motion machines, the increase of entropy,
      and the arrow of time all follow from ontological dissipation.
      
      Without dissipation, reality would 'freeze' into absolute identity,
      violating the foundational axiom.

  - id: "fix"
    symbol: "fix"
    full_name: "Fixation Operator"
    
    definition: |
      The operation that stabilizes distinctions (produced by diff) into discrete,
      identifiable, and repeatable entities. Enables modeling, prediction, and
      scientific formalization.
      
      fix is only possible in Logos (models), where the prohibition is suspended
      for epistemic purposes. In Monos, fix is ontologically impossible.
    
    signature: "fix: Distinction → Entity"
    
    ontological_status: "derivative"
    
    derived_from: 
      - "CORE/operators.yaml#diff"
      - "CORE/axioms.yaml#axiom_ban_of_absolute_identity"
    
    relationship_to_CMI: |
      fix is the epistemic complement to the ontological CMI structure:
      - In Monos: Prohibition enforces momentum; fix is impossible
      - In Logos: Prohibition is suspended; fix enables modeling
      
      fix allows us to create stable models despite ontological flux.
    
    applicable_to:
      - category: "logos"
        category_ref: "CORE/ontology.yaml#categories/logos"
        status: "fundamental"
        notes: |
          In Logos, fix is the foundational operation enabling models.
          All scientific theories depend on fix to create stable entities.
      
      - category: "monos"
        category_ref: "CORE/ontology.yaml#categories/monos"
        status: "ontologically_impossible"
        notes: |
          In Monos, fix cannot be instantiated. Any attempt to fix reality
          would violate the prohibition of absolute identity. Dissipation
          actively prevents fixation.
    
    properties:
      - property: "Selectivity"
        description: "fix selects specific aspects of diff for stabilization"
        
      - property: "Discretization"
        description: "Converts continuous distinctions into discrete entities"
        
      - property: "Repeatability"
        description: "Enables identity: fix(x) = x within a model"
    
    physical_correspondence:
      ontology: "Fixation (epistemic stabilization)"
      physics: "Conservation laws in idealized closed systems"
      notes: |
        In Logos, we model systems as 'closed' with conserved energy, momentum, etc.
        In Monos, no system is truly closed; dissipation always operates.
    
    formal_constraints:
      - "fix: Logos only (∄ fix in Monos)"
      - "fix ∘ diff ≠ identity (fixation is always selective, lossy)"
      - "∀ x ∈ Logos: fix(x) = x (operational stability)"
    
    examples:
      - domain: "physics"
        instance: "Particle as fix of quantum field excitations"
        reference: "To be developed in ONTODYNAMICS/PHYSICS/"
      
      - domain: "measurement"
        instance: "Measurement outcome as fix of quantum superposition"
        reference: "To be developed in ONTODYNAMICS/PHYSICS/quantum_mechanics.yaml"
      
      - domain: "biology"
        instance: "Species as fix of evolutionary differentiation"
        reference: "To be developed in ONTODYNAMICS/BIOLOGY/"
    
    related_operators:
      - "diff"
      - "dissipate"
    
    relationship_to_diff: |
      fix is ontologically posterior to diff:
      1. diff produces distinctions (Monos-level)
      2. fix stabilizes selected distinctions into entities (Logos-level)
      
      fix is an epistemic operation, not an ontological one.
      It represents our capacity to model reality, not reality itself.
    
    relationship_to_dissipate: |
      fix and dissipate are opposites but operate at different levels:
      - In Monos: dissipate prevents fixation (ontological enforcement)
      - In Logos: fix enables modeling (epistemic necessity)
      
      They do not conflict because they operate in different categories.
    
    notes: |
      The impossibility of fix in Monos is a direct consequence of the
      prohibition and dissipation. If fix were possible in Monos,
      absolute identity could be instantiated, violating the axiom.
      
      All scientific models operate through fix. The iterative refinement
      of science consists in discovering new distinctions (diff) that
      previous fixations failed to capture, and recognizing dissipative
      effects that models neglected.
