# ================= OPERATORS =================

operators:
  - id: "diff"
    symbol: "diff"
    full_name: "Differentiation Operator"
    
    definition: |
      The fundamental operation that produces distinctions from a continuous,
      processual substrate. Ontologically primary and cannot be reduced to
      more basic operations.
    
    signature: "diff: Process → Distinction"
    
    ontological_status: "primitive"
    
    derived_from: "CORE/axioms.yaml#axiom_ban_of_absolute_identity"
    
    applicable_to:
      - category: "monos"
        category_ref: "CORE/ontology.yaml#categories/monos"
        status: "fundamental"
        notes: |
          In Monos, diff is the only ontologically primitive operation.
          Reality exists as perpetual differentiation.
      
      - category: "logos"
        category_ref: "CORE/ontology.yaml#categories/logos"
        status: "modeled"
        notes: |
          In Logos, diff can be represented and modeled, but is always
          a fixation (approximation) of the Monos-level process.
    
    properties:
      - property: "Non-reversibility"
        description: "diff cannot be 'undone' to restore absolute identity"
        
      - property: "Continuity"
        description: "Operates on processual, non-discrete substrate"
        
      - property: "Context-dependence"
        description: "Distinctions emerge relative to observational/modeling frame"
    
    formal_constraints:
      - "∀ x ∈ Monos: diff(x) ≠ ∅ (distinctions always exist)"
      - "diff is not invertible: no diff⁻¹ operation exists"
    
    examples:
      - domain: "physics"
        instance: "Quantum measurement as diff operation on superposed state"
        reference: "To be developed in ONTODYNAMICS/PHYSICS/"
      
      - domain: "biology"
        instance: "Cell differentiation as actualization of genetic distinctions"
        reference: "To be developed in ONTODYNAMICS/BIOLOGY/"
      
      - domain: "cosmology"
        instance: "Spacetime expansion as continuous diff of metric tensor"
        reference: "ONTODYNAMICS/COSMOLOGY/redshift.yaml"
    
    related_operators:
      - "fix"
    
    notes: |
      diff is not a function in the classical mathematical sense
      (deterministic input → output). It represents the ontological fact
      that reality is inherently and perpetually differentiating.
      
      The prohibition of absolute identity (axiom_ban_of_absolute_identity)
      necessitates diff as the fundamental ontological operation.

  - id: "fix"
    symbol: "fix"
    full_name: "Fixation Operator"
    
    definition: |
      The operation that stabilizes distinctions (produced by diff) into discrete,
      identifiable, and repeatable entities. Enables modeling, prediction, and
      scientific formalization.
    
    signature: "fix: Distinction → Entity"
    
    ontological_status: "derivative"
    
    derived_from: 
      - "CORE/operators.yaml#diff"
      - "CORE/axioms.yaml#axiom_ban_of_absolute_identity"
    
    applicable_to:
      - category: "logos"
        category_ref: "CORE/ontology.yaml#categories/logos"
        status: "fundamental"
        notes: |
          In Logos, fix is the foundational operation enabling models.
          All scientific theories depend on fix to create stable entities.
      
      - category: "monos"
        category_ref: "CORE/ontology.yaml#categories/monos"
        status: "ontologically_impossible"
        notes: |
          In Monos, fix cannot be instantiated. Any attempt to fix reality
          would violate the axiom of indifference prohibition.
    
    properties:
      - property: "Selectivity"
        description: "fix selects specific aspects of diff for stabilization"
        
      - property: "Discretization"
        description: "Converts continuous distinctions into discrete entities"
        
      - property: "Repeatability"
        description: "Enables identity: fix(x) = x within a model"
    
    formal_constraints:
      - "fix: Logos only (∄ fix in Monos)"
      - "fix ∘ diff ≠ identity (fixation is always selective, lossy)"
      - "∀ x ∈ Logos: fix(x) = x (operational stability)"
    
    examples:
      - domain: "physics"
        instance: "Particle as fix of quantum field excitations"
        reference: "To be developed in ONTODYNAMICS/PHYSICS/"
      
      - domain: "measurement"
        instance: "Measurement outcome as fix of quantum superposition"
        reference: "To be developed in ONTODYNAMICS/PHYSICS/quantum_mechanics.yaml"
      
      - domain: "biology"
        instance: "Species as fix of evolutionary differentiation"
        reference: "To be developed in ONTODYNAMICS/BIOLOGY/"
    
    related_operators:
      - "diff"
    
    relationship_to_diff: |
      fix is ontologically posterior to diff:
      1. diff produces distinctions (Monos-level)
      2. fix stabilizes selected distinctions into entities (Logos-level)
      
      fix is an epistemic operation, not an ontological one.
      It represents our capacity to model reality, not reality itself.
    
    notes: |
      The impossibility of fix in Monos is a direct consequence of the
      indifference prohibition axiom. If fix were possible in Monos,
      absolute identity could be instantiated, violating the axiom.
      
      All scientific models operate through fix. The iterative refinement
      of science consists in discovering new distinctions (diff) that
      previous fixations failed to capture.
