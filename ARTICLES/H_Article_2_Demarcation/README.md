# Article 2: "Demarcation: Why Metamonism is Not Philosophy"

**Status:** Published | **Author:** Andrii Myshko (Metamonist)

## Synopsis
This critical article addresses a fundamental boundary: it argues that Metamonism is **not a philosophical system** in the traditional speculative sense, but a **minimal ontological framework** compatible with the scientific method. It discusses criteria of falsifiability and how they apply to the core and its derivative models in physics and cosmology.
