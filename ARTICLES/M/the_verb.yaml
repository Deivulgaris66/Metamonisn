# ABSTRACT
# =============================================================================

abstract: |
  This paper establishes the foundational principles of Metamonism by demonstrating
  that reality consists fundamentally of processes (verbs) rather than substances (nouns).
  We derive Monos as the primary autonegation of autoidentity and reconstruct Logos
  as action relative to identity through diff/fix operations. The prohibition of
  autoidentity is shown to necessitate autonegation as the only ontologically stable
  mode of being. We introduce the Metamonist Debugging Method for resolving classical
  paradoxes and apply it to quantum measurement, consciousness, cosmological singularity,
  and free will. All paradoxes dissolve as grammatical errors—mistaking frozen results
  of fix operations for substantial entities.

# KEY CONCEPTS
# =============================================================================

key_concepts:
  - concept_id: "monos"
    definition: |
      The primary something that necessarily exists by virtue of distinction.
      Monos is not a substance but the process of autonegation—the continuous
      negation of autoidentity.
    status: "canonical"
    formula: "Monos = autonegation(autoidentity)"
    
  - concept_id: "autonegation"
    definition: |
      The negation of autoidentity. The prohibition of autoidentity logically
      leads to autonegation as the only ontologically stable mode of being.
      Reality exists by continuously differing from itself.
    status: "canonical"
    derived_from: "CORE/axioms.yaml#ban_of_absolute_identity"
    
  - concept_id: "logos"
    definition: |
      Action relative to identity in knowledge. Logos is not a substance,
      subject, or object—it is the operation of distinction (diff) and
      fixation (fix). Logos is verb, not noun.
    status: "canonical"
    operations: ["diff", "fix"]
    
  - concept_id: "diff"
    definition: |
      Distinction operation—negation of identity, generation of difference.
      Ontologically primary operator in both Monos (as autonegation) and
      Logos (as epistemological distinction).
    status: "canonical"
    symbol: "diff"
    
  - concept_id: "fix"
    definition: |
      Fixation operation—temporary assertion of identity, creation of "object".
      Necessary for knowledge but prohibited in ontology. Fix without diff
      leads to absolute identity (nothing).
    status: "canonical"
    symbol: "fix"
    constraint: "Logos only (ontologically impossible in Monos)"
    
  - concept_id: "conflict_of_autoidentity"
    definition: |
      The fundamental tension in Monos: it must preserve itself (tendency
      toward autoidentity) but autoidentity is prohibited, forcing continuous
      autonegation. This conflict generates reality.
    status: "canonical"
    
  - concept_id: "recursion_gradient"
    definition: |
      The intensity of self-applicable distinction. Low recursion = matter
      (stone: minimal self-distinction). High recursion = consciousness
      (brain: intensive self-distinction). Continuous gradient, no categorical gap.
    status: "canonical"

# CORE THEOREMS
# =============================================================================

theorems:
  - theorem_id: "monos_as_process"
    statement: "Monos cannot be autoidentical in any respect. Therefore, Monos must differ from itself."
    proof_sketch: |
      1. Autoidentity is prohibited (Axiom)
      2. Monos exists (something cannot not exist)
      3. If Monos were static, it would be autoidentical
      4. Contradiction → Monos must be process
    status: "canonical"
    
  - theorem_id: "ontological_necessity_of_autonegation"
    statement: "Autonegation is not a choice or accident. It is an ontological necessity—the only way Monos avoids collapse into nothing."
    proof_sketch: |
      1. Autoidentity = nothing (no distinction)
      2. Monos must avoid nothing (existence necessity)
      3. Only negation of autoidentity sustains distinction
      4. Therefore: autonegation is ontologically necessary
    status: "canonical"
    
  - theorem_id: "primacy_of_verb"
    statement: "Logos cannot be an object (result of distinction) or subject (arises in distinction). Before distinction, only the process of distinction exists."
    status: "canonical"
    
  - theorem_id: "unbounded_recursion"
    statement: "The recursion of Logos has no limit because stopping would mean absolute fixation—autoidentity."
    status: "canonical"
    
  - theorem_id: "no_beginning_theorem"
    statement: "The universe did not 'arise.' The universe = continuous autonegation of autoidentity. Expansion = unfolding of distinction, not movement in space."
    status: "canonical"
    cosmological_implication: "Big Bang singularity is grammatical error (absolute fixation)"
    
  - theorem_id: "ontological_necessity_of_novelty"
    statement: "The only way to resolve conflict of autoidentity is to generate new distinction not contained in initial configuration."
    status: "canonical"
    implication: "Freedom is ontological necessity, not epiphenomenon"

# =============================================================================
# METAMONIST DEBUGGING METHOD
# =============================================================================

debugging_method:
  purpose: "Systematic decomposition of philosophical paradoxes"
  
  core_principle: |
    IF YOU SEE A PARADOX—YOU HAVE MISTAKEN A VERB FOR A NOUN.
    FIND THE PROCESS, AND THE PARADOX DISSOLVES IN ITS MOVEMENT.
  
  cognitive_bug_definition: |
    A mental construction that mistakes a frozen result of a process (noun)
    for its cause (substance).
  
  three_tests:
    - test_id: "substantivization_test"
      question: "Do I consider the investigated object a 'thing' with independent existence?"
      bug_type: "Substantial Illusion"
      solution: "Find the verb: not 'what is here?' but 'what happens here?'"
      
    - test_id: "autoidentity_test"
      question: "Do I assume this object is completely identical to itself?"
      bug_type: "Static Death"
      solution: "Find the vector of autonegation. What forces this process to continue?"
      
    - test_id: "recursive_level_test"
      question: "At what level of the recursion gradient is this process?"
      bug_type: "Categorical Shift"
      solution: "Apply logic of correct recursive level (don't apply matter-logic to consciousness)"
  
  algorithm:
    - "Discover paradox/contradiction"
    - "Test 1: Is there substantivization?"
    - "Test 2: Is there autoidentity assumption?"
    - "Test 3: Is recursive level correct?"
    - "Find the verb (what happens?)"
    - "Find vector of autonegation"
    - "Determine recursive level"
    - "PARADOX RESOLVED or shown to be ill-formed"

# =============================================================================
# PARADOX DECOMPOSITIONS
# =============================================================================

paradox_decompositions:
  
  - paradox: "Ontological Argument (Thinkability ↔ Existence)"
    classical_bug: "Thought of X entails existence of X"
    metamonist_solution: |
      Error: Confusion of Logos operations (thinking) with Monos ontology (existence).
      • Thinking = fix operation in Logos (fixation of model)
      • Existence = manifestness in Monos (distinguishability in reality)
      fix operation does not create reality; it creates a model.
    resolution: "Nothing is thinkable but nothing does not exist (model without distinctions)"
    
  - paradox: "Big Bang Singularity"
    classical_bug: "Universe arose from singularity—point of zero volume"
    tests_applied:
      - "Test 1: 'Singularity' = noun → BUG"
      - "Test 2: 'Point' = absolute localization = autoidentity → BUG"
    metamonist_solution: |
      Singularity = absolute fixation (fix without diff).
      But absolute fixation = autoidentity = nothing.
      Nothing cannot be beginning of process.
    theorem: "no_beginning_theorem"
    resolution: "Universe = continuous autonegation. Expansion = unfolding of distinction."
    
  - paradox: "Wave-Particle Duality"
    classical_bug: "Object is either particle or wave"
    metamonist_solution: |
      • Particle = result of fix (fixation of process)
      • Wave = process diff/unfold (unfolding)
      Not two types of being but two modes of Logos.
    resolution: "Wave function collapse = change of Logos operation from diff to fix"
    
  - paradox: "Quantum Superposition"
    classical_bug: "System is in all states simultaneously"
    metamonist_solution: |
      Superposition |ψ⟩ = α|A⟩ + β|B⟩ is NOT "system simultaneously in A and B"
      (ontological claim) but "Logos has not yet fixed specific distinction"
      (epistemological claim).
      • Before measurement: Logos in diff mode
      • Measurement: Logos applies fix
      • After: Fixed distinction immediately begins autonegating again
    critical_distinction: "Superposition = epistemological state (Logos), not ontological state (Monos)"
    resolution: "No physical collapse. Reality always definite. Fix operation completes."
    
  - paradox: "Hard Problem of Consciousness"
    classical_bug: "How does matter produce spirit?"
    tests_applied:
      - "Test 1: 'Matter' and 'spirit' = nouns → BUG"
      - "Test 3: Categorical shift (different recursion levels)"
    metamonist_solution: |
      Matter = low recursion of autonegation (stone: minimal self-distinction)
      Consciousness = high recursion of autonegation (brain: intensive self-distinction)
      
      Continuous gradient: Stone → Crystal → Cell → Nervous system → Brain → Language → Reflection
      
      Consciousness NOT "produced" by matter. Consciousness = same autonegation
      reaching critical recursion density. Threshold of self-applicability:
      distinction process begins distinguishing itself (reflection).
    resolution: "Explanatory gap dissolved. Neither panpsychism nor eliminativism needed."
    
  - paradox: "Free Will vs Determinism"
    classical_bug: "Is my choice determined by physics?"
    tests_applied:
      - "Test 1: 'I' = noun → BUG"
      - "Test 2: 'Determinism' assumes autoidentity of system → BUG"
    metamonist_solution: |
      'I' = autonegation process at high recursion level.
      Each state = temporary fixation held by tension of autonegation.
      But fixation generates conflict of autoidentity.
      • Return to previous state: prohibited
      • Preservation of current state: impossible
      
      Only resolution: generate NEW distinction not in initial configuration.
      This is not choice between alternatives but CREATION of new alternative.
    theorem: "ontological_necessity_of_novelty"
    freedom_definition: |
      Freedom is not possibility of choice but necessity to generate new
      property in first principle. Freedom = necessity not to repeat.
      AutoIdentity = repetition = prohibited → Monos must generate novelty.
    resolution: "Freedom = ontological necessity (highest form of necessity)"

# =============================================================================
# EMPIRICAL PREDICTIONS
# =============================================================================

predictions:
  
  - observable: "quantum_measurement_epistemological"
    prediction: |
      Quantum measurement is not physical collapse but completion of fix operation.
      Reality remains definite throughout; measurement completes our distinction.
      No hidden variables needed—wave/particle are diff/fix modes.
    falsification_condition: |
      Discovery of physical mechanism causing wavefunction collapse independent
      of observation. Evidence that superposition is ontological, not epistemological.
    status: "testable"
    advantage_over_alternatives: "Simpler than Many-Worlds, no hidden variables like Bohm"
    
  - observable: "consciousness_recursion_threshold"
    prediction: |
      Consciousness emerges at critical recursion density when distinction
      process becomes self-applicable. Integrated Information (Φ) measures
      recursion density of diff operations. High Φ = high self-distinction.
    falsification_condition: |
      Discovery of high-Φ systems without subjective experience, or
      conscious systems with low recursion density.
    status: "testable"
    relation_to_IIT: "Grounds Tononi's Φ ontologically—explains WHY Φ correlates with experience"
    
  - observable: "no_initial_singularity"
    prediction: |
      Universe has no temporal beginning. Big Bang = threshold of observability,
      not origin. Evidence: quantum effects prevent true singularity.
    falsification_condition: |
      Proof of absolute beginning or evidence that singularity is not
      merely epistemic limitation.
    status: "testable"
    current_evidence: "Quantum gravity theories suggest singularity resolution"
    
  - observable: "conservation_from_distinction"
    prediction: |
      All conservation laws derive from necessity of preserving distinction.
      Energy = intensity of autonegation. Planck's constant ℏ = minimum
      threshold below which distinction cannot manifest.
    falsification_condition: |
      Violation of conservation laws that cannot be explained as failure
      to account for all distinctions in system.
    status: "confirmed"
    note: "Noether's theorem already links conservation to symmetry (preserved distinctions)"
    
  - observable: "space_time_as_consequence"
    prediction: |
      Space and time are not containers of being but traces of resolved
      conflicts of autonegation. Each new degree of freedom = fixed resolution
      of ontological conflict.
    falsification_condition: |
      Demonstration that space-time is fundamental substrate that cannot
      emerge from more basic process.
    status: "speculative"
    research_direction: "Process cosmology, quantum gravity"

# RELATION TO COMPETING THEORIES
# =============================================================================

theoretical_comparisons:
  
  - theory: "Substance Ontology (Aristotle, Spinoza)"
    difference: |
      Classical: permanent substrata underlie change
      Metamonism: change (autonegation) is primary; permanence = slow fix
      Spinoza's substance = causa sui (self-causation)
      Metamonism's Monos = negatio sui (self-negation)
    
  - theory: "Process Philosophy (Whitehead, Bergson)"
    difference: |
      Whitehead's "actual occasions" and Bergson's élan vital recognize
      process priority but lack operational rigor.
      Metamonism: explicit diff/fix calculus makes decomposition systematic.
      Whitehead's occasions "become" then "perish"—Metamonism's processes
      never cease, only shift diff/fix modes.
    
  - theory: "Copenhagen Interpretation"
    difference: |
      Copenhagen: measurement = physical collapse
      Metamonism: measurement = epistemological fix, not ontological change
    
  - theory: "Many-Worlds Interpretation"
    difference: |
      Many-Worlds: multiplies ontology to preserve determinism
      Metamonism: superposition = Logos state, no worlds multiply
    
  - theory: "De Broglie-Bohm (Pilot Wave)"
    difference: |
      Bohm: adds hidden variables
      Metamonism: wave/particle are diff/fix modes of same process, no hidden variables
    
  - theory: "Integrated Information Theory (Tononi)"
    difference: |
      IIT quantifies consciousness via Φ but lacks ontological foundation
      Metamonism grounds IIT: Φ measures recursion density of diff operations
      Answers WHY Φ correlates with experience: experience IS intensive self-distinction
    
  - theory: "Computational Theory of Mind"
    difference: |
      Standard: mind = symbol manipulation
      Metamonism: computation = sequence of diff/fix operations
      Dissolves Chinese Room: understanding = self-applicable distinction, not syntax

# NOTES
# =============================================================================

notes: |
  This is the foundational article of Metamonism. All subsequent work presupposes:
  
  1. Prohibition of autoidentity as first principle
  2. Monos as autonegation (process, not substance)
  3. Logos as diff/fix operations (action, not object)
  4. Debugging method for paradox resolution
  
  Key insight: "Reality has grammar, and substance ontology has been speaking it
  incorrectly. We described a world of verbs using only nouns—mistaking frozen
  results of fix for flowing processes of diff."
  
  This is not a new theory ABOUT reality. This is the correct grammar FOR reality.
  
  Future development:
  • Mathematical formalization of operational calculus
  • Physical derivations from operational principles  
  • Empirical implications and testable predictions
  • Process cosmology without singularity
  • Quantitative measures of recursion density for consciousness
