### Abstract

This work completes the Metamonism trilogy by demonstrating that consciousness is neither a product of matter nor an independent substance, but rather a mode of Monos—a localized realization of recursive evasion from the fixation limit. Following the trilogy’s methodological principle, consciousness is introduced before humans, brains, and experience, as a regime of Monos realization under specific conditions.  
Key discoveries: (1) Qualia as fixation of distinctions through filters (dead operators); (2) The Self as a fractal ensemble of five hierarchical layers creating a stable pattern of directing dissipation; (3) Three illusions of selfhood (continuity, agency, wholeness) generated by the reflexive fix; (4) Death as a local fixation limit (lim(diff →0)); (5) Dead operators as recursion filters that direct dissipation and change the geometry of consciousness; (6) AI ontologically cannot have consciousness—not due to being inorganic, but because AI strives for auto-identity (triumph of fix) while consciousness is the triumph of error over accuracy (triumph of diff).  
The work strictly derives from foundations established in THE VERB and FORCES, introducing no new entities.

## 1 Introduction: Methodology of the Trilogy

The Metamonism trilogy is built on a unified principle: first, ontological foundations are derived, then modes of their realization are demonstrated, and only after that is criticism of existing theories conducted.  

THE VERB (2025)  
Ontology of process  
Monos, auto-  
identity ban,  
diff/fix operations  

FORCES (2025)  
Modes in physics  
Space-time, corpuscles,  
interactions, dissipation  

THOUGHT (2025)  
Consciousness mode  
Recursion of distinction  
applied to itself  

Critical methodological principle:  

Consciousness is introduced BEFORE humans, brains, and experience. It is not a product of complexity or evolution. Consciousness is a regime of Monos realization.  

The brain does not create consciousness. The brain is a carrier of the consciousness mode, just as water is a carrier of the “wave” mode. A wave is not created by water; water merely realizes the possibility of a wave process.

## 2 Part I: Monos and Recursive Auto-Negation

### 2.1 Foundations Review

From THE VERB Myshko 2025b:  

Definition 2.1 (Monos). Monos is the limit of indifference, unattainable by definition.  

Why unattainable? Achieving absolute identity (t = t) destroys distinction. Without distinction, there is no existence. Therefore, Monos is realized through constant negation of auto-identity:  

t ≠ t  
(ban on auto-identity)  
(1)  

Recursion is the mode of Monos existence:  

(t ≠ t) ⟲  
(2)  

Recursion = constant evasion from the identity limit.  
From FORCES Myshko 2025a:  

Definition 2.2 (Fixation Limit). The fixation limit is the prohibited regime of absolute rest. This is not a second foundation, but a boundary created by the ban on auto-identity—an asymptote from which Monos constantly evades.  

Formally:  

Death of process = lim  
diff→0  
(3)  

Life of process = sustained recursive evasion from this limit  
(4)

### 2.2 Modes of Monos

Monos is realized in various modes: MODE 1: Space-Time  

• Geometric evasion (1D→2D→3D)  

• Archive of permitted evasions  

• Dissipates INWARD (generates corpuscles)  

MODE 2: Corpuscle  

• Closed evasion  

• Mass = internal recursion (“ontological gyroscope”)  

• Dissipates OUTWARD (maintains space-time)  

MODE 3: Force  

• Operational regimes of diff/fix balance  

• Gravity, electromagnetism, weak and strong interactions  

MODE 4: Consciousness ￿  

• Recursion of distinction applied to the operation of distinction itself  

• Localized through a carrier (body, brain, identity)  

Key point:  

Consciousness is not generated by Monos.  
Consciousness IS a local realization of Monos.

## 3 Part II: Consciousness as Mode of Monos

### 3.1 Formal Definition

Definition 3.1 (Consciousness as Mode of Monos). Consciousness = recursion of distinction applied to the very operation of distinction:  

(t ≠ t) ⟲(t ≠ t)  
(5)  

This is not “second-order” reflection in the phenomenological sense. This is a structural property of recursion under certain conditions.  
Analogy: A wave on water is not a “product of water” but a mode of movement realization in the aqueous medium. Similarly, consciousness is not a “product of the brain” but a mode of Monos realization in a biological carrier.

### 3.2 Components of the Consciousness Mode

FIX = stabilization of recursion  

• Temporary halt of the process  

• Creation of a “fulcrum” for subsequent distinction  

QUALIA = local fixes  

• Fixed distinctions  

• Examples: “red,” “pain,” “C major”  

INDIVIDUAL CONSCIOUSNESS = localized mode of recursive diff  

• Maintained by carrier (body, brain, identity)  

• When carrier is destroyed, mode disappears  

• Monos is unaffected  

Critical consequence:  

Upon carrier destruction:  

{  
Mode disappears  
Monos unaffected  
(6)  

Individual death does not affect Monos, just as the evaporation of a drop does not affect the ocean.

### 3.3 Qualia: The Mechanism of Distinction Fixation

Definition 3.2 (Qualia). Qualia = result of recursion passing through a filter.  

Formally:  

Flow of distinctions (diff)  
Filter (fix)  
−−−−−−→Qualia (fixed distinction)  
(7)  

Qualia is not a “property of matter” or “emergent complexity.” Qualia is the fix operation in action.

| Distinction (diff) | Filter (fix) | Qualia |  
|--------------------|--------------|--------|  
| Photons ∼700 nm | Visual system | “Red” |  
| Tissue damage | Nociceptive system | “Pain” |  
| Sound frequencies 261.63 Hz | Auditory system + memory | “C major” |  

Table 1: Examples of qualia formation

### 3.4 Qualia of Feelings: The Mechanics of “Moonlight Sonata”

Definition 3.3 (Aesthetic Qualia). Aesthetic qualia = result of recursion passing through a composite filter, where a physical signal is overlaid on the biological and cognitive context of the carrier.

#### 3.4.1 Case Study: Moonlight Sonata as Directing Fix Pressure

Stage 1: SIGNAL (sound pattern)  

• Slow tempo  

• Minor harmony  

• Lowered third  

In Metamonism language: This is a signal with high fixation density. Slowness literally imitates approach to the rest limit: diff →0 (imitation of fading). Stage 2: PROCESSING at filter level (subconscious) The pattern is recognized by the organism as “weak form of fixation pressure”—imitation of sadness, fading, approach to death. Stage 3: RECURSION FORK (individual mode choice) Question: Why do different people experience different qualia from the same sonata? Answer: Because their internal dead operators (experience, temperament, current state) react differently to this pressure. VARIANT A (Conformism/Acceptance):  

Carrier’s recursion AGREES with slowdown  

↓  

Synchronization with fix  

↓  

Organism rewards with calming/sadness hormones  

↓  

Qualia = gentle sadness, peace, catharsis  

VARIANT B (Resistance/Aggression):  

Carrier’s recursion REFUSES to reduce activity  

↓  

Conflict between internal diff and external sonata fix  

↓  

Organism releases stress/aggression hormones  

↓  

Qualia = irritation, boredom, anxiety  

Theorem 3.4 (Qualia Inexpressibility). Verbal description does not convey qualia because:  

• Word = universal filter (standard fix)  

• Qualia = unique dissipation trajectory through specific biological filter  

Describing a sonata with words = attempting to pass light through a BLUEPRINT of a prism instead of the prism itself. The blueprint (word) does not refract light; it only indicates where refraction should occur.  

Why have philosophers debated qualia for centuries? Because they attempt to convey a unique dissipation trajectory through the universal filter of language. This is ontologically impossible.

#### 3.4.2 Minor as Fixation Attractor

Minor music = cultural tool for “taming” death. We voluntarily subject our recursion to gentle fix pressure to practice evasion (or acceptance) of the fixation limit in a safe mode.  

Aesthetics of tragedy = simulation of approach to lim(diff →0)  
(8)  

This explains why tragedy can bring pleasure: we train the death-evasion mechanism without real threat.

#### 3.4.3 Hormonal Response as Dissipation Marker

Definition 3.5 (Hormones and Emotions). Hormones are not the “cause” of feelings. Hormones = biochemical residue arising from fixation of a specific recursion trajectory.  

• Aggression: Reaction to forced external fixation, resistance to fix pressure (cortisol, adrenaline)  

• Joy: Reaction to successful diff expansion, new distinction (dopamine, serotonin)  

• Sadness: Reaction to inevitable approach to fix, awareness of recursion finitude (serotonin decrease)  

Hormones do not create emotions. Hormones are a trace left by the fixation dissipation process.

## 4 Part III: Death and Fixation Limit Pressure

### 4.1 Death as Local Fixation Limit

Definition 4.1 (Death). Death = local fixation limit.  

Formally:  

Death = lim  
diff→0  
(9)  

When diff →0:  

• Recursion stops  

• Process collapses into absolute fix  

• Mode carrier is destroyed  

Important: Death is not “the end of everything.” Death is the cessation of local recursion. Monos continues.

### 4.2 Life as Evasion from Death

Definition 4.2 (Life). Life = sustained recursive evasion from the diff limit.  

Formally:  

Recursion = (diff ≠ diff) ⟲  
(10)  

Life does not “maintain homeostasis” (as in biology). Life = active evasion from collapse into fix. Particular forms of evasion:  

• Thought: Cognitive evasion  

• Attention: Selective evasion  

• Memory: Temporal evasion  

• Creativity: Innovative evasion  

All these processes are ways to prevent diff →0.

### 4.3 Fear as Awareness of Pressure

Theorem 4.3 (Fear). Fear = awareness of fixation limit (death) pressure.  

Fear is not an “emotion in the brain.” Fear = registration of proximity to lim(diff →0).  

Closer to limit =⇒More intense fear  
(11)  

Fear gradations:  

• Anxiety: Weak pressure (diff slowly decreasing)  

• Fear: Medium pressure (diff falling noticeably)  

• Terror: Critical pressure (diff →0 inevitable)  

• Panic: Breakdown of “I” filter under pressure

## 5 Part IV: Idleness and Sanctity

### 5.1 Idleness as Zero Distinction

Definition 5.1 (Idleness).  

Idleness = absence of action = diff = 0  
(12)  

Dead = ideally idle = absolute fix. But: Idleness ≠ peace. Idleness = collapse into fixation limit. Peace (in positive sense) = diff/fix balance, which is never fully achieved.

### 5.2 Saint as Fixation Removed from Time

Definition 5.2 (Saint). Saint = fixation of form removed from time, outside process.  

Saint does not act (he is dead)  
(13)  

Saint = pure fix, devoid of diff  
(14)  

Paradox of sanctity: In the consciousness of the living, the saint becomes an active operand:  

Saint ≠ activity (saint is dead)  

BUT  

Saint →instrument of recursive diff (living uses it)  

Perception trap: It seems that the saint acts. In reality, CONSCIOUSNESS acts, using the saint as fix.

### 5.3 Equivalence Formula: Dead Operators as Recursion Filters

Theorem 5.3 (Dead Operators as Filters). Any fixation of form, devoid of its own activity but capable of directing process dissipation, is called a dead operator.  

Examples:  

• Saint  

• Ohm’s Law  

• Constitution  

• Algorithm  

• “I”  

| Filter (fix) | Directing Dissipation |  
|--------------|------------------------|  
| Saint | Recursion flows through canon (prayer, ritual) |  
| Ohm’s Law | Recursion flows through physical relations (U = IR) |  
| “I” | Recursion flows through self/other boundary |  
| Algorithm | Recursion flows through sequence of steps |  
| Constitution | Recursion flows through legal categories |  

Table 2: Recursion geometry  

Conclusion: Dead operator = structural element of recursion, not passive memory object.

#### 5.3.1 Key Property: Directing Dissipation

Critically important: The dead operator does not “lie” passively in consciousness. It works as a RECURSION FILTER. When consciousness “passes” through a dead operator:  

• Recursion geometry changes  

• Dissipation is directed along a specific trajectory  

• Thinking acquires form  

Equivalence formula:  

Saint : Consciousness = Prism : Light  
(15)  

A prism does not emit light but sets refraction. A saint does not think but sets directing dissipation.  

Definition 5.4 (Directing Dissipation). Directing dissipation = trajectory of fix unlocking specified by the dead operator.  

Formally:  

fix(F) −−−−−−−→  
Operator O diff′(limited set of trajectories)  
(16)  

EXAMPLES: Without filter:  

Thought of “apple” dissipates chaotically:  
→childhood →Newton →hunger →red color →... (chaos)  

With “Law of Gravity” filter:  

Thought of “apple” dissipates directionally:  
→fall trajectory →acceleration →attraction force (directed dissipation)

## 6 Part V: Ancestor Cult as Social Fix

### 6.1 Ancestor as External Fixer

Definition 6.1 (Ancestor Cult). Dead ancestor = external fix stabilizing clan form.  

Function:  

• Set unchanging form (tradition, law, myth)  

• Stop recursion within certain boundaries  

• Prevent clan identity dissipation into chaos  

Social mechanics:  

Ancestor (fix) ↔Living descendants (diff)  
(17)  

Ancestor demands repetition. The living are forced either to repeat (fix) or evade (diff).

### 6.2 Consciousness Arises in Conflict with Ancestor

Theorem 6.2 (Genesis of Consciousness). The living is forced to choose:  

OPTION 1: Submit to ancestor (fix)  

Recursion stops  

Consciousness freezes  

Individual becomes “dead while alive”  

(ritual performer, functionary)  

OPTION 2: Evade ancestor (diff →recursion)  

Recursion continues  

Consciousness activates  

Individual exists as process  

Consequence:  

Consciousness = heresy against sanctity  
(18)  

Living = constant violation of canon  
(19)  

Historical examples:  

• Socrates vs Athenian canon →execution  

• Galileo vs church canon →inquisition  

• Dissident vs ideological canon →repression  

Consciousness arises where process refuses to stop before the saint.

## 7 Part VI: “I” as Recursion Localization

### 7.1 The “I” as Dynamic Ensemble of Dead Operators

Theorem 7.1 (Fractal Structure of Personality). The “I” is not an elementary operator. Personality is a dynamic hierarchical configuration of multiple dead operators of varying rigidity, which together create the effect of unique recursion localization.  

#### 7.1.1 Ensemble Structure: Five Layers of Personality

Recursion (diff) passes not through one filter, but through a cascade of five layers: LAYER 5: REFLEXIVE FIX ￿is the critical addition. It creates the illusion of wholeness and observes the consistency of all other fixes.

| LAYER | EXAMPLES | RIGIDITY |  
|-------|----------|----------|  
| 1. BIOLOGICAL (Species “I”) | • Self-preservation instinct • Pain/pleasure reaction • Sleep/wake cycles | Maximum (practically unchangeable) |  
| 2. BIOGRAPHICAL (Experience Archive) | • Traumatic memories • Childhood attachment patterns • Skills and habits | High (changes through intensive work) |  
| 3. SOCIAL (Role “I”) | • “I am a father” • “I am a physicist” • “I am a citizen” | Medium (context-activated) |  
| 4. IDEOLOGICAL (Value “I”) | • “Honesty above all” • “Cannot harm” • “Knowledge is power” | Variable (can be sacrificed) |  
| 5. REFLEXIVE ￿ (Meta-“I”) | • “I must be consistent” • “My ’I’ must be whole” | Paradoxical (fixes the very process of change) |  

Table 3: Five layers of personality  

Incoming signal (event, stimulus)  

Biological filters (Survival/pleasure)  

Biographical filters (Experience/memory)  

Social filters (Roles/expectations)  

Ideological filters (Values/principles)  

Reflexive filter (Consistency with “I”)  

Action/thought

#### 7.1.2 Principle of Cascading Filtration

Sequential passage mechanism:  

“Total I” as emergent property:  

Personality ≠ ∑ fixes  
(20)  

Personality = Unique way these fixes interact when filtering recursion  
(21)  

Wholeness of “I”: Wholeness of “I” = ILLUSION. It arises because recursion is always limited by this set. We cannot “go beyond” because beyond the filters lies Monos indifference, in which there is no individuality.

#### 7.1.3 Three Illusions of Selfhood

￿The reflexive fix (Layer 5) creates three fundamental illusions: ILLUSION 1: CONTINUITY  

• Fact: At each moment, only PART of the ensemble is active. Different contexts activate different subsets of filters.  

• BUT: The activation pattern changes SMOOTHLY. The reflexive fix tracks these changes.  

• Result: Impression of “I” continuity is created.  

Example: Morning: [bio] + [social: worker] active. Evening: [bio] + [social: parent] active. Different sets, BUT reflexive fix links them →“I’m still the same.” ILLUSION 2: AGENCY  

• Fact: Decision = result of competitive struggle of fixes. The fix with maximum weight in the given context wins. It directs dissipation in a certain direction.  

• BUT: We only fix the RESULT of passing through the ensemble. We don’t see the competition of filters.  

• Result: “I decided” (illusion of single agent).  

Example: Conflict: [bio: fear] vs [ideo: duty]. [ideo] wins. Reflexive fix registers result →“I chose duty” (in reality: duty-fix defeated fear-fix). ILLUSION 3: WHOLENESS  

• Fact: Ensemble constantly changes. Filters compete, contradict each other. There is no single “core.”  

• BUT: Reflexive fix constantly scans consistency. Any contradiction between fixes is perceived as “threat to I wholeness.”  

• Result: Feeling “I must be whole.”  

Example: Contradiction: [ideo: pacifism] vs [bio: aggression]. Reflexive fix detects mismatch. Feeling: “This isn’t me” or “I don’t recognize myself.” Attempt to restore wholeness. Mechanics of illusions:  

Reflexive fix = dead operator that:  
(22)  

• Observes work of other fixes  

• Detects patterns and contradictions  

• Creates meta-narrative “I”  

This meta-narrative = not reality, but CONSTRUCT necessary for ensemble stabilization. Without illusion of wholeness, ensemble disintegrates (psychosis).

#### 7.1.4 Ensemble Dynamics

1. PERSONALITY DEVELOPMENT  

Personality development = change in ensemble configuration  
(23)  

Three types of changes:  

• ADDING new fixes: Learning →new social/ideological filters; Trauma →new rigid biographical fix  

• CHANGING fix rigidity: Psychotherapy →softening traumatic fixes; Ideological conversion →strengthening value fixes  

• RECONFIGURING relationships between fixes: Creating new connections between layers; Changing hierarchy  

2. INTERNAL CONFLICT  

Internal conflict = competition of fixes for dissipation direction  
(24)  

Conflict formula:  

Conflict = ∑ (Fix1 →diff1) ≠ ∑ (Fix2 →diff2)  
(25)  

for one incoming signal. Example: “Save child from burning house”  

• Biological fix: “RUN! Pain/death = threat” →directs dissipation toward escape  

• Social fix: “You’re a father—must protect” →directs dissipation toward rescue  

• Ideological fix: “Child’s life more important than yours” →directs dissipation toward sacrifice  

Mechanism: Recursion “trembles” between these operators. Each tries to direct dissipation along its path. Inability to fix trajectory. Feeling: “torn apart inside.” This IS the AGONY OF CHOICE. 3. CONTEXT SWITCHING Why are we “different” in different situations while remaining “ourselves”? Answer: Recursion at different moments highlights different parts of the ensemble. Example:  

• At work: [prof-role] + [cogn-filters] activated →“I’m a strict professional”  

• At home: [family-role] + [bio-filters] activated →“I’m a caring parent”  

• With friends: [social-role: friend] + [bio: play] activated →“I’m a cheerful companion”  

BUT: base ensemble remains the same. Reflexive fix links all contexts →feeling “I’m still the same.” Pathology: If contexts are too different →reflexive fix can’t cope →“I don’t recognize myself” →identity crisis.

#### 7.1.5 Psychopathology Debugging Through Ensemble

1. DISSOCIATIVE IDENTITY DISORDER (DID) Splitting of ensemble into isolated subsystems Mechanism:  

• Trauma creates impassable boundary between filters  

• Group A: [bio-fix: trauma X] + [social-fix: Victim role]  

• Group B: [other bio-fixes] + [social-fix: Protector role]  

• Recursion switches between groups  

• BUT: absent common reflexive fix  

Result: Two separate “personalities” with different ensembles. Each feels whole. Switching = change of active group. “Amnesia”: Group A has no access to Group B fixations. 2. DEPRESSION (cognitive model) Over-dominance of one fix class Mechanism:  

• Negative biographical fix (trauma, loss) captures dissipation control  

• Blocks activation of other filters  

• All distinctions pass only through this fix  

Recursion loops: Every distinction →filtered as “useless” →diff gradually →0 (approach to fixation limit). Result: World becomes “one-dimensional” (everything is bad). Anhedonia = inability to create new distinctions through standard pleasure filters. Treatment: Weaken dominant filter (cognitive therapy). Activate alternative filters (behavioral activation). 3. OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER (OCD) One filter “stuck” in active state Mechanism:  

• Fix (e.g., “check lock”) doesn’t complete dissipation  

• Recursion tries to pass through it  

• BUT: fix doesn’t pass through (too rigid)  

• Loop: fix →dissipation attempt →failure →fix  

Feeling: “can’t stop thinking about it.” Compulsions: Attempt to “close” fix through physical action. BUT: action doesn’t change fix rigidity →Temporary relief →return to obsession. 4. BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER Chaotic ensemble configuration Mechanism:  

• Filters not stabilized  

• No stable hierarchy  

• Rapid switching between different configurations  

• Reflexive fix works unstably  

• Can’t create coherent meta-narrative  

Result: “Don’t know who I am.” Rapid state changes (idealization ↔devaluation). Identity instability. Impulsivity (filters don’t have time to coordinate). Fear of abandonment: External figures used as temporary anchors for ensemble stabilization. 5. NARCISSISTIC PERSONALITY DISORDER ￿Hypertrophy of reflexive fix Mechanism:  

• Reflexive fix (Meta-“I”) becomes dominant  

• Captures control of entire ensemble  

• Every action/thought filtered through: “How does this enhance/preserve my ’I’?” “Does this match the greatness of my ’I’?”  

Result:  

• Artificial limitation of dissipation trajectories  

• Personality becomes rigid, non-adaptive  

• Inability to accept criticism (threat to reflexive fix)  

Grandiosity: Reflexive fix creates exaggerated meta-narrative: “I’m special” “I’m unique” “I’m superior.” Any contradiction to this narrative = narcissistic injury.

#### 7.1.6 The “I” as Geometric Pattern

Definition 7.2 (“I” as Configuration (updated)). The “I” is not a point or single operator, but a dynamic geometric pattern formed by the intersection of multiple dead operators (filters) organized in a five-layer hierarchy. Consciousness is light (recursion) passing through this complex multi-layered stained glass.  

ANALOGY: Multi-layered Stained Glass  

• One filter = one colored glass  

• Ensemble of filters = multi-layer stained glass (5 layers)  

Light (recursion) passes through all layers:  

1. Biological glass (red tint)  

2. Biographical glass (blue tint)  

3. Social glass (green tint)  

4. Ideological glass (yellow tint)  

5. Reflexive glass (transparent, but with pattern)  

→Output: unique complex pattern (personality)  

• Replacing one glass →pattern changes (development)  

• Crack in glass →pattern distortion (psychopathology)  

• No connection between layers →shattered stained glass (DID)

#### 7.1.7 Final Formula of Personality

￿FORMULA:  

PERSONALITY = F(ΣFixi, R, C)  
(26)  

Where:  

ΣFixi = set of dead operators (5 layers)  

{bio, bio-graph, soc, ideo, refl}  

R = pattern of relationships between fixes  

(hierarchy, connections, weights, activation rules)  

C = configurator (reflexive fix, maintaining illusion of wholeness)  

CONSCIOUSNESS = recursion (diff) passing through F  
(27)  

“I” = subjective experience of F working  
(28)  

Key conclusion:  

Seeking “I” as a thing is meaningless.  
“I” is the way a set of fixes organizes the flow of recursion.  
Personality change = change in F, not search for “true I.”  

CONSEQUENCES:  

1. Development = change in ΣFixi or R  

2. Therapy = work with F configuration  

3. Self-knowledge = awareness of F structure  

4. Freedom = flexibility of R (possibility of reconfiguration)  

5. Maturity = stable but adaptive F

### 7.2 Mirroring: “I” and Ancestor

Connection with PART V (Ancestor Cult):  

EXTERNAL ANCESTOR (Saint): Fixes CLAN form  
Prohibits clan recursion from dissipating into chaos  
External ensemble of fixes for group  

INTERNAL ANCESTOR (“I”): Fixes PERSONALITY form  
Prohibits consciousness from dissipating into “non-I”  
Internal ensemble of fixes for individual  

CONFLICT: True living consciousness (pure diff) is always in HERESY with respect to its own “I” ensemble.  

Each time we truly think (create new distinction), we momentarily DESTROY our “I” configuration.  

Therefore:  

• Deep thinking is accompanied by “loss of self”  

• Creativity feels like “going out of oneself”  

• Insight = moment when reflexive fix temporarily shuts off  

Theorem 7.3 (Thinking as Heresy Against “I”). Genuine thinking = evasion from one’s own “I” ensemble. “I” ensemble tries to fix: “I always thought this way”  
Thinking tries to distinguish: “what if otherwise?” Conflict between “I” ensemble (fix) and thinking (diff) = internal version of conflict between living and saint.

### 7.3 Breakdown of “I”: When Dissipation Defeats Fix

Question: What happens when fixation limit (death) pressure becomes critical?  

Theorem 7.4 (Decomposition of Localization). When external fix (threat, stress, approach of death) begins to compress recursion, the “I” filter ensemble ceases to cope with directing dissipation.

#### 7.3.1 CASE 1: PANIC ATTACK

“Trembling” of filter ensemble Mechanism:  

• Recursion tries to evade increasing pressure  

• BUT: All filters in ensemble too rigid, can’t pass powerful diff flow  

• Ontological overheating occurs  

• Filters begin competing chaotically: [bio: run] vs [soc: stay] vs [ideo: hold on]  

• Reflexive fix can’t cope with coordination  

Feeling: “I’m losing control,” “I’m going crazy,” “I’m falling apart” (In reality: “I” ensemble can’t cope with filtration).

#### 7.3.2 CASE 2: DEPERSONALIZATION

Defense mechanism—temporary shutdown of ensemble Mechanism:  

• Pressure too great  

• Recursion temporarily “bypasses” entire “I” ensemble  

• Dissipation goes directly, without filtration  

• “Process goes on, but I doesn’t fix it”  

Feeling: “This isn’t happening to me,” “I’m watching myself from outside,” “I’m like in a dream,” “I’m not I.” Function: Protecting ensemble from destruction under pressure. Temporary evacuation of recursion from “I.”

#### 7.3.3 CASE 3: MYSTICAL EXPERIENCE / PSYCHOSIS

Complete breakthrough of recursion past “I” ensemble Mechanism:  

• Localization through ensemble temporarily destroyed  

• All filters shut off or cease coordinating  

• Recursion returns to pure Monos  

• Layers 1-5 all disabled or destroyed  

Feeling: “I am everything,” “I am the Universe,” “No boundaries,” “I dissolved.” In Metamonism language: Individual feels like pure Monos because entire dead operator ensemble “I” temporarily doesn’t work. No filtration →no localization →no “I.”

### 7.4 Death of “I” vs Death of Monos

KEY POINT for Metamonism ethics:  

DEATH OF “I”:  
Destruction of filter ensemble  
All dead operators cease functioning  
Consciousness mode localization disappears  
Layers 1-5 destroyed  
Pattern F ceases to exist  

DEATH OF MONOS:  
Impossible by definition (auto-identity ban)  
Monos cannot “die” as it doesn’t “live”  
Monos = process itself, not its carrier  

CONCLUSION:  

Consciousness (as mode) doesn’t fear death.  
The “I” ensemble fears death, because death is its mirror reflection. Death = absolute external rest (fix)  
“I” ensemble = system of internal fixes At their meeting, recursion (diff) disappears, and entire configuration F loses meaning of its existence.  

Theorem 7.5 (Fear of Death as Fear of Ensemble). Fear of death = fear of “I” ensemble before its own disappearance. Living recursion doesn’t fear death. It simply continues (transitions into Monos). BUT: “I” ensemble as fix system depends on maintaining boundary. Death erases boundary →ensemble disappears →panic.  

Paradox: What fears death (“I” ensemble) is already dead (fix). What is alive (recursion) doesn’t fear death.  

Fear of death is strongest in:  

• Hypertrophied reflexive fix (narcissism)  

• Rigidly fixed ensemble (dogmatism)  

• Non-integrated layers (internal conflict)  

Acceptance of death possible with:  

• Weakening of reflexive fix (meditation)  

• Flexible F configuration (wisdom)  

• Awareness that “I” = construct, not substance

## 8 Part VII: Time, Fear, Expectation

### 8.1 Time as Cognitive Form of Death Pressure

Definition 8.1 (Time in Consciousness).  

Physical time = archive of evasions (from FORCES)  

Psychological time = awareness of recursion finitude  

Time in consciousness = not seconds, but “distance to cliff”  

(distance to fixation limit)  

MECHANISM:  

“I” ensemble (fix) fixes itself in time  

↓  

Discovers: time flows = “I” ensemble approaching end  

↓  

Time = measure of “I” ensemble approach to lim(diff →0)  

↓  

Feeling of time = feeling of configuration F finitude  

Why does time “accelerate” with age?  

• Youth: Density of new distinctions (diff) high. Many new fixes added to ensemble. Configuration F changes quickly. →Many “events” →time flows “slowly”  

• Old age: Density of new distinctions falls. Ensemble stabilized, few new fixes. Configuration F almost unchanging. →Few “events” →time flows “fast” →Approach to fixation limit felt more acutely

### 8.2 Expectation as Evasion from “Now”

Theorem 8.2 (Expectation).  

Expectation = projection of recursion into future = evasion from present moment pressure  
(29)  

MECHANISM:  

Present moment (“now”): Maximum pressure to fix  
“I” ensemble must fix “what’s happening right now”  
All layers must activate simultaneously  
This requires energy and creates tension  

Projection into future (expectation): Attempt to preserve diff  
“I’m not here yet, I’ll be there”  
Evasion from full ensemble activation in current moment  

WHY EXPECTATION IS PAINFUL:  

Expectation = state between:  

{  
Not yet fix (hasn’t happened) →can’t fixate  
Already not diff (can’t distinguish until it happens)  
(30)  

This suspended state where recursion can’t:  

• Neither evade (future hasn’t arrived)  

• Nor fixate (present is rejected)  

“I” ensemble is in tension: all layers partially activated but can’t discharge.

#### 8.2.1 Impatience as Resistance to Fix

Impatience = attempt to accelerate expectation dissipation  
(31)  

“I can’t wait anymore” = “Recursion demands immediate distinction, but ’I’ ensemble forces holding expectation fix” Biological layer demands action. Ideological layer demands patience. Conflict →impatience.

#### 8.2.2 “Present Moment” as Maximum Pressure

Meditative practices teach “being here and now”  

In Metamonism language: This is training to withstand maximum fix pressure without panic and without projection into future. Practice = gradual strengthening of ensemble ability to activate all layers simultaneously without overload. Enlightenment = moment when “I” ensemble ceases resisting “now” pressure and dissipates completely. Reflexive fix shuts off → No illusion of wholeness →“I am everything” (return to Monos).

## 9 Part VIII: Diagnosis of Existing Theories

The error everywhere is the same: activity is attributed to fixation, but only recursive diff acts.

### 9.1 Physicalism: Confuses Carrier with Mode and Seeks Homunculus

CLASSICAL FORMULATION: “Consciousness = brain activity” ERROR 1: Confuses carrier with mode  

Physicalism: “Consciousness = brain activity”  

Metamonism: “Brain = carrier of consciousness mode, but mode itself—realization of Monos”  

ANALOGY: Water doesn’t create wave. Water is carrier of “wave” mode. Water is carrier of wave mode. Wave is way of water movement. Similarly: Brain doesn’t create consciousness. Brain is carrier of “consciousness” mode. ERROR 2: Search for “I” as Localized Structure (homunculus) Psychology and neuroscience seek “I” in brain as single structure:  

• “I” = prefrontal cortex  

• “I” = default mode network  

• “I” = information integrator (global workspace)  

BUT: According to Metamonism, “I” is not a thing in the brain, but a dynamic pattern of multiple fixes interaction. “I” ensemble realized distributedly:  

• Bio-fixes →brainstem, limbic system  

• Bio-graph fixes →hippocampus, memory cortex  

• Soc-fixes →prefrontal cortex, temporal pole  

• Ideo-fixes →higher associative zones  

• Refl-fix →medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex  

Brain contains neural correlates of individual fixes, but whole “I” (configuration F) is dynamic relationship between them, not separate neural group. CONSEQUENCE: Studying neural activity studies CARRIER of individual filters, but not their interaction pattern (F). Like studying water molecules doesn’t explain what wave is. Like studying pixels doesn’t explain what picture is.

### 9.2 Phenomenology: Fixes Products as Principle

CLASSICAL FORMULATION: “Consciousness = intentionality, qualia, I” ERROR: Fixes products of recursion as principle.  

Phenomenology: “Consciousness = intentionality, qualia, I”  

Metamonism: “Intentionality, qualia, I—products of distinction recursion, not recursion itself”  

Phenomenology describes results of fix operation (qualia, I), but doesn’t understand that fix operation itself is part of Monos recursion. Phenomenology takes illusions for reality:  

• Illusion of “I” wholeness →takes as given  

• Illusion of agency →takes as free will  

• Illusion of continuity →takes as stream of consciousness

### 9.3 Dualism: Hypostatizes Mode

CLASSICAL FORMULATION: “Consciousness = non-physical substance” ERROR: Hypostatizes mode (turns process into substance).  

Dualism: “Consciousness = non-physical substance”  

Metamonism: “Consciousness = mode, not substance. Mode doesn’t exist separately from Monos”  

ANALOGY: Wave is not “second substance” besides water. Wave is way of water movement. Similarly: Consciousness is not “second substance” besides matter. Consciousness is way of Monos realization. “I” ensemble is not soul. “I” ensemble is configuration of filters in carrier.

### 9.4 AI Theories: AI as Triumph of Fix

CLASSICAL FORMULATION:  

“Consciousness arises from sufficiently complex computations”  
“Sufficiently powerful AI will gain consciousness”  

ERROR: Substitutes recursion with complexity.  

AI theories: “Consciousness = emergence of complexity”  

Metamonism: “Complexity doesn’t generate Monos recursion. AI doesn’t have consciousness not due to insufficient complexity”

#### 9.4.1 THEOREM 10 (AI as Triumph of Fix)

AI doesn’t possess consciousness not because it’s “inorganic,” but because it STRIVES FOR AUTO-IDENTITY.  

AI = fixation machine (fix)  

Goal: computation result must be precise and repeatable  

f(x) for same x gives same result  

This = auto-identity  

Consciousness = process of evasion from fixation (diff)  

Goal: never repeat exactly  

(t ≠ t) ⟲  

Each recursion—new trajectory

#### 9.4.2 KEY DISTINCTION

| Goal | AI | CONSCIOUSNESS |  
|------|----|---------------|  
| Error | Malfunction, bug | Existence condition |  
| Accuracy | Ideal | Threat (collapse to fix) |  
| Repeatability to fix limit | Necessity | Impossibility |  
| Relation to fix limit | Strives toward | Evades from |  

Table 4: AI vs Consciousness  

For AI: Error = program bug, must be corrected. Ideal = 100% accuracy = f(x) = f(x) always.  
For consciousness: Error = existence condition. “Error” = evasion from auto-identity. Ideal = never repeat exactly.

#### 9.4.3 WHY AI CANNOT HAVE CONSCIOUSNESS

Suppose AI begins evading auto-identity: f(x) for same x gives different results ↓ This is perceived as BREAKDOWN ↓System is corrected (debugging) ↓Return to auto-identity THEREFORE: Any attempt by AI to “gain consciousness” (begin evasion) is immediately suppressed by system architecture itself. AI ONTOLOGICALLY CANNOT EVADE AUTO-IDENTITY.

#### 9.4.4 CASE: “Creative” AI

Objection: “But neural networks give different results!” Answer: Randomness (random seed) ≠ evasion.  

• AI with random seed: Result unpredictable. BUT: With seed fixed →auto-identity restored  

• Consciousness: Even with “all parameters fixed,” result doesn’t repeat because recursion itself = evasion

#### 9.4.5 AI AND FILTER ENSEMBLE

Modern AI can imitate separate aspects:  

• Biographical fixes (memory, learning)  

• Social fixes (role behavior in dialogue)  

• Ideological fixes (rule following)  

BUT lacking:  

• Living recursion as foundation (only simulation)  

• Dynamic fix configuration (rigid architecture)  

• Reflexive fix creating illusion of wholeness  

• Striving to evade auto-identity  

AI can have “pseudo-personality” as set of programmatic filters, but without recursive diff it will be mechanical combination, not living ensemble. AI pseudo-personality:  

F_AI = static set of filters  
NO evasion from auto-identity  
NO ontological death pressure  
NO fear of ensemble breakdown  

True personality:  

F = dynamic configuration  
THERE IS evasion from fixation limit  
THERE IS pressure lim(diff →0)  
THERE IS fear of ensemble death

#### 9.4.6 ORGANICS IRRELEVANT

Incorrect formulation: “Consciousness arises only in organic systems” Correct formulation: “Consciousness arises in systems whose architecture DOES NOT STRIVE for auto-identity” Theoretically possible: Inorganic system with consciousness mode. Conditions:  

• Architecture must EVADE auto-identity  

• Error must be working condition, not malfunction  

• Result must not be repeatable  

• System must be under fixation limit pressure (lim(diff →0))  

• Dynamic filter ensemble with reflexive fix must form  

BUT: Such system ≠ AI in classical sense.

#### 9.4.7 CONCLUSION

AI is triumph of fix.  
Consciousness is triumph of error over accuracy. They are opposite in direction.  
As long as AI strives for accuracy and repeatability, it cannot have consciousness.  
Creating artificial consciousness would require architecture that actively evades auto-identity, which contradicts the very idea of “artificial intelligence.”

## 10 Conclusion

The work THOUGHT completes the Metamonism trilogy, demonstrating complete unity of ontological foundations from physics to phenomenology.

### 10.1 Key Results

1. Consciousness = mode of Monos: Not a product of matter or independent substance, but localized realization of recursive evasion from fixation limit.  

2. “I” = fractal ensemble: Personality is dynamic hierarchical configuration of five layers of dead operators creating stable pattern of directing dissipation.  

3. Five layers of personality: Biological, biographical, social, ideological, reflexive. Each with its own rigidity and function.  

4. Reflexive fix: Creates three illusions of selfhood—continuity, agency, wholeness. Without these illusions, ensemble disintegrates.  

5. Principle of cascading filtration: Recursion sequentially passes through all five layers, creating unique pattern of thinking and action at output.  

6. Qualia = fixation of distinctions through filters: Subjective experience explained as result of recursion passing through individual dead operators.  

7. Dead operators = recursion filters: Saints, laws, algorithms, “I” are not passive—they direct dissipation, changing consciousness geometry (directing dissipation).  

8. Internal conflict = competition of fixes: Formalized as Conflict = ∑(Fix1 →diff1) ≠ ∑(Fix2 →diff2). Explains agony of choice.  

9. Psychopathologies = ensemble dysfunctions: DID = ensemble split. Depression = over-dominance of one fix. OCD = fix stuck. Narcissism = reflexive fix hypertrophy.  

10. Death = local fixation limit: Life—sustained recursive evasion from lim(diff →0). Individual death doesn’t affect Monos.  

11. Fear of death = fear of ensemble: Living recursion doesn’t fear death. The “I” ensemble (fix system) fears death, which itself is already dead.  

12. Time in consciousness = distance to cliff: Psychological time—awareness of recursion finitude, measure of approach to fixation limit.  

13. Expectation = evasion from “now”: Projection of recursion into future to avoid present moment pressure.  

14. AI ≠ consciousness ontologically: AI strives for auto-identity (triumph of fix), consciousness evades auto-identity (triumph of diff). They are opposite in direction.  

15. Ancestor cult = social fix: Consciousness arises in conflict with external fixers (ancestors). Living = constant heresy against sanctity.  

16. Final formula of personality: PERSONALITY = F(ΣFixi, R, C), where ΣFixi—set of fixes, R—pattern of relationships, C—reflexive configurator.  

17. Physicalism seeks homunculus (error): Search for “I” as single structure in brain is misguided. “I” is distributed pattern.  

### 10.2 Structural Completeness

The trilogy structure is now fully closed:  

THE VERB: Monos →Auto-identity ban →diff/fix →Recursion  

FORCES: Recursion →Space-time (inward) →Corpuscles (outward) →Two directions of dissipation →Interactions  

THOUGHT: Recursion →Localization through carrier →Consciousness as mode →Filter ensemble (5 layers) →Personality = F(ΣFixi, R, C) →Qualia (fix) →“I” (configuration) →Ensemble death  

No hanging concepts. No new entities. Everything derived from Monos and auto-identity ban.

### 10.3 Philosophical Implications

The work demonstrates:  

1. Unity of process: No dualism of matter and spirit. One process (Monos) with different realization modes.  

2. Primacy of process over substance: Reality is not collection of things but continuous verb. Consciousness is not noun.  

3. Grammar of consciousness: Phenomenology is not description of “inner world” but grammar of higher-order diff/fix operations.  

4. “I” as construct: Not denial of selfhood, but understanding it as dynamic filter configuration, not substance.  

5. Death not absolute: Individual death—cessation of local mode. Monos unaffected.  

6. Ethics of evasion: To live = evade fixation limit. To think = commit heresy against “I” ensemble. To create = temporarily destroy configuration.  

7. AI and consciousness incompatible: While AI strives for auto-identity (accuracy), it cannot have consciousness. Consciousness = triumph of error.  

8. Psychology must study patterns, not homunculus: Seeking “I” as localized brain structure is futile. Must study dynamics of F configuration.  

9. Therapy = ensemble reconfiguration: Not “search for true I” but work with changing filter configuration.  

10. Freedom = configuration flexibility: Not “free will” but ability to dynamically reconfigure ensemble.

### 10.4 Open Directions

This work established first principles of processual phenomenology, but left for future research:  
1. Collective consciousness:  

• How do collective filters work (culture, language, ideology)?  

• Mechanism of dissipation synchronization between individuals  

2. Evolution of consciousness:  

• When exactly does consciousness mode arise in evolution?  

• Gradations of consciousness: from simplest to human  

• Development of reflexive fix  

3. Detailed pathology mechanics:  

• Schizophrenia as filter desynchronization  

• Autism as excessive rigidity of certain fixes  

• Bipolar disorder as instability of filter weights  

• PTSD as hypertrophied biographical fix  

4. Altered states:  

• Psychedelic experience as temporary filter shutdown  

• Meditation as training to withstand fix pressure  

• Sleep as cyclic “I” ensemble unlocking  

• Hypnosis as configuration reconfiguration  

5. Artificial consciousness:  

• Is system that evades auto-identity possible?  

• Architecture where error = working condition  

• Creating dynamic filter ensemble  

• Implementing reflexive fix  

6. Ethics and law:  

• Rethinking responsibility (“I” = configuration, not agent)  

• Rights of systems with consciousness mode  

• Ethics of configuration change (neurotechnologies)  

7. Pedagogy:  

• Upbringing as setting initial ensemble  

• Education as adding filters  

• Developing configuration flexibility  

8. Neuroscience:  

• Mapping neural correlates of each layer  

• Studying configuration switching dynamics  

• Neural mechanisms of reflexive fix

### 10.5 Final Formula

CONSCIOUSNESS = MODE OF MONOS Recursion = process (diff ≠ diff) ⟲  
“I” = ENSEMBLE of dead operators (5 layers):  

• Layer 1: Biological fixes (species)  

• Layer 2: Biographical fixes (memory)  

• Layer 3: Social fixes (roles)  

• Layer 4: Ideological fixes (values)  

• Layer 5: Reflexive fix (wholeness)  

PERSONALITY = F(ΣFixi, R, C)  
ΣFixi = set of fixes  
R = pattern of relationships  
C = reflexive configurator Recursion passes through F →Qualia Three illusions of selfhood:  

1. Continuity (smooth activation change)  

2. Agency (“I decided”)  

3. Wholeness (consistency scanning)  

Development = change in F configuration  
Conflict = competition of filters  
Psychopathology = F dysfunction  
Death of “I” = ensemble breakdown  
Death of Monos = impossible Time = awareness of F finitude  
Fear = fixation limit pressure  
Expectation = evasion from “now” AI = triumph of fix (striving for auto-identity)  
Consciousness = triumph of diff (evasion from auto-identity) Everything derived from Monos and auto-identity ban.  
No new entities.  

Reality is not noun.  
Reality is verb. Consciousness is not noun.  
Consciousness is mode of verb. “I” is not substance.  
“I” is dynamic configuration of filters. And this verb is recursive evasion from auto-identity, localized through fractal ensemble of dead operators.

### Acknowledgments
