### Abstract

This work debugs fundamental concepts of physics through the lens of Metamonism.  
The author demonstrates that matter, space, and forces are not independent entities but represent stages of recursive evasion of the primary process (the Verb) from the state of auto-identity.  
For the first time, a unified definition of the four interactions is given as operational regimes of balance between Distinction (diff) and Fixation (fix).  
It is shown that gravity results from mutual screening of masses in an ocean of centrifugal pressure arising from continuous dissipation of all corpuscles. Electromagnetism is interpreted as dynamic oscillation between diff operations (electric field) and fix operations (magnetic field). Weak interaction is explained as a mechanism for discharging excess distinction during structure stabilization. Strong interaction is linked to the irrationality of π, which prevents absolute closure of the sphere.  
The central discovery: dissipation is the continuous destruction of symmetry and identity, necessary to avoid auto-identity. This is an ontological necessity built into the very fact of structure existence.  
Furthermore, we establish that there exist two generations of closed structures with opposite directions of dissipation: space-time dissipates inward (generating corpuscles), while corpuscles dissipate outward (sustaining space-time). This creates a closed dynamic non-equilibrium cycle ensuring the stability of the manifest world without achieving equilibrium.  
The work builds upon foundations laid in the treatise “THE VERB: On First Principles” Myshko 2025 and develops processual ontology toward physics and cosmology.

## 1 Introduction: From Grammar of Being to Physics of Process

In the work “THE VERB: On First Principles” Myshko 2025, it was established that reality is not a collection of objects but a continuous process of auto-negation of auto-identity. Being is defined as Monos—a process that avoids collapse into nothing through constant distinction from itself.  
Cognition is defined as Logos—action relative to identity, carried out through operations diff (distinction) and fix (fixation).  
The present work develops these foundations toward physics. If “THE VERB” answered the question “how is the grammar of reality structured?”, then “FORCES” answers “how does the process move within the structure it creates?”.  
Central thesis: Forces of nature are not independent interactions but operational regimes of balance between Distinction and Fixation. Matter, space, and time are not givens but results of recursive evasion of the process from forbidden auto-identity.  
Critical terminological clarification: Unlike “THE VERB”, where it was strictly proven that Nothing does not exist as a separate foundation, in the physical part we will use the term “limit of fixation” to denote the forbidden regime of absolute rest. This is not a second foundation but a boundary created by the prohibition of auto-identity—an asymptote from which Monos constantly evades.

## 2 Part I: Ontological Poles

### 2.1 Monos and the Limit of Fixation

**Axiom 2.1 (Conflict of Process and Limit).** At the foundation of reality lies tension between the process and its forbidden limit:  
- Monos (Verb / Something / Time / diff): Process of auto-negation of auto-identity. Active impulse toward infinite distinction. The sole genuine foundation.  
- Limit of Fixation (Space / Rest / fix): Forbidden regime of absolute fixation. Not an entity but an asymptote that the process cannot approach but from which it constantly evades.  

Critically important: The limit of fixation does not exist as a separate foundation—it is a boundary that Monos creates through the prohibition of auto-identity. This is not a second ontological pole but a forbidden state of the single process.  

Monos is primary, active. This is the process of distinction itself.  
The limit of fixation is secondary, reactive. This is what Monos cannot become (absolute rest = auto-identity).  
Ray of Causality—this is the primary trajectory of Monos evading the limit of fixation. The direction of distinction arising from the prohibition of auto-identity. All movement in the world is a result of this primordial evasion.

### 2.2 Causality as First Degree of Freedom

**Definition 2.1 (Ray of Causality).** Distinction generates a ray—a one-dimensional directed structure. This is not a line (symmetric) but precisely a ray (with origin and direction). The geometry of the ray reflects process irreversibility: auto-negation cannot return to a previous state (prohibition of auto-identity).

### 2.3 Evasion Mechanism: Generation of Dimensionality

Space-time is not an empty container. It is the geometry of Verb maneuvers—structure arising from tension between Monos (process) and the limit of fixation (forbidden regime of rest). Each point of space is a location where the process evaded the limit of fixation. Space = archive of evasions.  

**Definition 2.2 (Recursion as Course Change).** Recursion (Latin recursio—to return, change course) is the action of creating degrees of freedom through changing the direction of the process.  

Process of dimensionality generation:  
- 1D → 2D: The ray encounters resistance from the limit of fixation. To avoid stoppage (auto-identity), it evades—changes course perpendicularly. A plane emerges.  
- 2D → 3D: The limit of fixation continues acting on movement in the plane. The ray performs a second evasion—exits into the third dimension. Constant evasion along all axes leads to the process closing upon itself. A sphere is formed.  
- 3D → 4D: When pressure toward fixation continues growing, the process cannot evade “outward” (this would destroy the three-dimensional structure). It performs a fourth evasion—renews in multiple internal points of volume. Quantization arises.  

**Definition 2.3 (Mass).** Mass arises at the point of conflict closure along three degrees of freedom. This is an “ontological gyroscope” where the process loops, forming a stable “noun”. Mass = measure of fix (fixation) in the system.

### 2.4 Number π: Index of Evasion into Fractionality

**Theorem 2.1 (Irrationality as Protection from Auto-Identity).** The number π ≈ 3.14159 ... is the ratio of circle circumference to diameter. Its irrationality (infinite non-periodic fraction) means that the sphere cannot close ideally. Final fixation is unattainable. This creates a “tremor” at the boundary—the basis of quantization.  

Physical meaning: π is mathematical guarantee of impossibility of absolute fixation in three-dimensional volume. The process is forced to go into the fourth evasion (discreteness).

### 2.5 Golden Ratio ϕ: Coefficient of Optimal Action

**Definition 2.4 (Golden Ratio).** ϕ = (1 + √5)/2 ≈ 1.618 ... is the proportion at which the process can unfold maximally efficiently without repeating.  

Fibonacci numbers (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, …) describe optimal complexity buildup:  

F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}  

Each new distinction builds on the “shoulders” of previous fixations. This minimizes energy costs.  
Angle of no return: At the rhythm of recursion based on ϕ, the Verb never coincides with its past trace. This guarantees avoidance of auto-identity.

## 3 Part II: Ontodynamics

### 3.1 Conflict, Impulse, Moment

**Axiom 3.1 (Triad of Dynamics).**  
- Conflict = Cause. This is pressure of the prohibition of auto-identity. Ontological necessity to distinguish.  
- Impulse = Difference. This is a measure of realized distinction. p = ∆(process).  
- Moment = Fixation. This is the result of the fix operation. Temporary stoppage of the ray.  

Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:  

∆x · ∆p ≥ ħ/2  

This is not a limit of measurement precision but an ontological conflict of operations:  
- Fixing coordinate x (operation fix) destroys impulse p (difference/diff)  
- Observing impulse p (process diff) makes fixing coordinate x impossible

### 3.2 Fundamental Asymmetry

**Axiom 3.2 (Priority of Distinction).** diff > fix always.  
diff (Monos)—active process, primary.  
fix (limit of fixation)—reactive regime, secondary. If fix ≥ diff, absolute fixation would be possible → auto-identity → collapse → forbidden. This is not balance of two equal forces but asymmetry of process and its forbidden boundary.

## 4 Part III: Unified Theory of Interactions

### 4.1 Two Evasion Regimes: π and ϕ

All diversity of interactions reduces to two mathematical architects:  

| Interaction | Constant | Regime | Scale |  
|-------------|----------|--------|-------|  
| Strong | π | Internal (fractional) | Micro (sphere) |  
| Gravity | ϕ | External (spiral) | Macro (field) |  

### 4.2 Strong Interaction: π-Evasion

Mechanism: The irrationality of π does not allow the sphere to close ideally. This creates “tension” at boundaries—enormous energy density in ultra-small volume.  
Physical manifestation: Strong interaction is the process’s attempt to loop into a sphere (nucleus), which constantly “tremors” due to π. Quark confinement is topological necessity: an isolated “knot” of process cannot exist stably.

### 4.3 Electromagnetism: diff ↔ fix

**Theorem 4.1 (Dualism of Electromagnetism).** Electromagnetism is the only interaction where both regimes manifest symmetrically:  
- Electro = diff (distinction, opening)  
- Magnetism = fix (fixation, closure)  

Maxwell’s equations as operational grammar:  

∇ · ⃗E = ρ / ε₀ (electric field has sources—opening) (1)  

∇ · ⃗B = 0 (magnetic field always closed) (2)  

∇ × ⃗E = −∂⃗B / ∂t (change of fix generates diff) (3)  

∇ × ⃗B = μ₀⃗j + μ₀ε₀ ∂⃗E / ∂t (change of diff generates fix) (4)  

Photon—running wave of switching between operations. Z-axis open (diff dominates → no mass). X-Y axes oscillate ( ⃗E ⊥ ⃗B). Speed of light c—limiting frequency of transformation diff ↔ fix.

### 4.4 Gravity: Screening of Dissipation Flow

**Theorem 4.2 (Gravitational Shadow).** Gravity is not a force of attraction. It is a result of mutual screening of masses in an ocean of gravitational background created by continuous dissipation of all corpuscles.  

Mechanism:  
1. Space is a resistance structure arising from tension between process (Monos) and its forbidden limit (absolute fixation).  
2. Mass—closed “gyroscope”, source of constant centrifugal discharge of tension. This discharge is directed outward from mass, dissolving into Monos.  
3. Dissipation of all masses creates gravitational background—flow emanating from each corpuscle.  
4. Two masses mutually screen each other from this background. Between them arises a region of reduced pressure—“gravitational shadow”.  
5. External (unscreened) gravitational background “pushes” them together.  

Role of ϕ: Golden ratio determines mass structure as spiral process. Shadow density distributes according to ϕ.  
Consequences:  
- No “dark matter”—artifact of incorrect formula F ∝ 1/r² at galactic scales  
- Time dilation near masses—change in auto-negation rhythm in “shadow”  
- Black hole—object screening gravitational background almost completely

### 4.5 Weak Interaction: Discharge of Difference

**Theorem 4.3 (Necessity of Discharge).** Since diff (active) is always potentially greater than fix (reactive), when forming a closed structure (mass), excess “Verb” arises. For final stabilization, this excess must be discharged.  

Process of mass stabilization:  
1. Attempt to close sphere (3D)  
2. Discovery of imbalance: diff > fix  
3. Discharge of excess diff as radiation (photons) or through decay (weak interaction)  
4. Achieving balance: diff’ ≈ fix Stable mass  

Mass defect:  

E_binding = ∆m · c²  

Mass decreased not because “matter disappeared” but because the amount of internal tension (fix) requiring fixation decreased. Weak interaction is a “safety valve” purifying fixation from excess motion when soft discharge (radiation) is impossible.

## 5 Part IV: Temperature and Entropy

### 5.1 Temperature as Undischarged Excess

**Definition 5.1 (Temperature).** Temperature = measure of excess diff enclosed within fix. If excess cannot be discharged completely, the system “tremors”—we register this as heat.  

Absolute zero is forbidden:  

T = 0 =⇒ diff = fix (absolutely) =⇒ auto-identity =⇒ forbidden

### 5.2 Entropy as Global Discharge

**Definition 5.2 (Entropy in Metamonism).** Entropy—measure of global discharge of difference. The universe strives to discharge all active diff, converting it into radiation, approaching the limit of fixation (absolute rest). BUT: Prohibition of auto-identity does not allow reaching this limit (S_max) → cycle renews. Entropy is not a path to “death” but to a boundary that cannot be crossed.

## 6 Part V: Antimatter

### 6.1 Prohibition of Foundation Exchange

**Theorem 6.1 (Impossibility of Inversion).** Antimatter cannot mean “matter with opposite foundations” where Monos and limit of fixation exchange places. Monos is the sole foundation; it is immutable. Limit of fixation is not a second foundation but a forbidden boundary. Exchange “Monos → limit of fixation” would mean transformation of process into absolute rest = auto-identity = reality collapse.

### 6.2 Chirality: Mirror Course

Hypothesis: Antimatter is not foundation exchange but mirror direction of evasion:  
- Matter: right spiral ϕ (clockwise)  
- Antimatter: left spiral ϕ (counterclockwise)  

Foundation is the same (Monos), but evasion geometry from the limit of fixation is mirrored.  
Annihilation: Right spiral meets left → directions opposite → structures cannot coexist → both open → 100% discharge into radiation.

## 7 Part VI: Dissipation and Cosmological Cycle

### 7.1 Impulse as Primary Form of Dissipation

**Axiom 7.1 (Dissipativity of Impulse).** Impulse is not neutral transfer. Impulse is a channel of tension discharge. Any impulse is directed difference. Directed difference cannot be closed symmetrically. Consequently, impulse is dissipative by definition. Impulse = minimal act of symmetry destruction.  

Dissipation begins not after structure formation but already in the very act of motion.

### 7.2 Sphere as Forbidden Limit

**Theorem 7.1 (Impossibility of Ideal Sphere).** Sphere = ideal of symmetry and identity. Ideal sphere possesses:  
- Self-identity (all surface points equivalent)  
- Auto-symmetry (infinite rotational symmetry)  
- Absolute closure  

Consequently: Ideal sphere = auto-identity = FORBIDDEN.

### 7.3 Dissipation as Ontological Necessity

**Definition 7.1 (Dissipation).** Dissipation is continuous destruction of symmetry and identity necessary to avoid auto-identity. Any corpuscle is forced to constantly destroy its own symmetry to continue existing.  

Dissipation mechanisms:  
- Thermal motion (vibration)  
- Rotation  
- Radiation  
- Decay  
- Quantum fluctuations  

These are not environmental effects but conditions of ontological survival.

### 7.4 Recursion as Generation of Space-Time

**Theorem 7.2 (Space-Time as Archive of Conflicts).** Recursion is not repetition but course change (recursio). Primary tension between Monos and limit of fixation resolves into space-time. This is not a container but geometry of evasion. Each encounter with limit of fixation → maneuver → new degree of freedom. Space = archive of resolved evasions. Each point—location where process evaded limit.  
Time = order of impossibility of return. Prohibition of auto-identity makes time irreversible.

### 7.5 Mass as Internal Recursion

After closure along three degrees of freedom:  
- Further resolution outward impossible  
- Conflict begins resolving inward  

**Definition 7.2 (Mass as Gyroscope).** Mass = internal recursion of closed conflict. This is an “ontological gyroscope”:  
- Not rest  
- Not substance  
- But sustained discrepancy

### 7.6 Gravity: Centrifugal Discharge, Not Attraction

**Axiom 7.2 (Gravity as Dissipation).** Gravity is always centrifugal. Mass = source of constant tension discharge. This discharge is directed outward. It dissolves into space (returns to free distinction of Monos). Gravity = background effect of total dissipation of all corpuscles.  

Why does “attraction” effect arise?  

**Theorem 7.3 (Screening Principle).** Masses screen each other from gravitational background. Between them deficit of this background pressure arises. This deficit is perceived as “attraction”.  
Not attraction but mutual shadow.  
Not force but geometry of absence.  

Gravity is screening effect from centrifugal pressure of dissipation. This completely removes:  
- Mystique of action at distance  
- Problem “what transmits force”  
- Necessity of gravitons as entities

### 7.7 Two Directions of Dissipation: Closed Cycle

**Axiom 7.3 (Two Generations of Structures).** There exist two generations of closed structures with opposite dissipation directions:  
- FIRST GENERATION (Space-time): Closure of evasion into geometry (1D→2D→3D). Dissipates ONLY INWARD. Generates corpuscles through quantization.  
- SECOND GENERATION (Corpuscles): Closure into mass (internal recursion). Dissipate ONLY OUTWARD. Sustain space-time through radiation and gravitational background.  

These two directions form a closed dynamic non-equilibrium cycle ensuring stability of manifest world without achieving equilibrium.

#### 7.7.1 First Generation: Space-Time Dissipates Inward

Formation mechanism:  
Monos evades limit of fixation  
↓  
Ray (1D) → Plane (2D) → Volume (3D)  
↓  
First closure = SPACE-TIME  

Dissipation direction: Space-time cannot dissipate “outward”—outward would mean return to Monos, which would destroy the very geometry of evasion. Consequently, dissipation goes inward:  
- Formation of corpuscles  
- Quantization (fourth evasion)  
- Structure complexification  
- Mass appearance  

Space-time = “maternal” structure generating corpuscles as mode of its dissipation.

#### 7.7.2 Second Generation: Corpuscles Dissipate Outward

Formation mechanism:  
Space-time dissipates inward  
↓  
Formation of closed structures (masses)  
↓  
Corpuscles = SECOND GENERATION of closure  

Dissipation direction: Corpuscles cannot dissipate “inward into themselves”—they are already maximally closed along three degrees of freedom. Further closure would mean collapse into auto-identity. Consequently, dissipation goes outward:  
- Radiation (photons, neutrinos)  
- Gravitational background (centrifugal discharge)  
- Decay (weak interaction)  
- Energy return to space-time  

Corpuscles = “daughter” structures whose dissipation sustains space-time existence.

#### 7.7.3 Closed Dynamic Non-Equilibrium Cycle

SPACE-TIME  
↓ (dissipation inward)  
↓  
CORPUSCLES  
↓ (dissipation outward)  
↓  
SPACE-TIME  
↓  
…  

Cycle properties:  
1. Closure: Two dissipation directions compensate each other  
2. Dynamism: Cycle never stops  
3. Non-equilibrium: Compensation incomplete (diff > fix always)  
4. Self-sustenance: System stable without external energy

#### 7.7.4 Why No Equilibrium

**Theorem 7.4 (Impossibility of Balance).** Two dissipation directions compensate each other, but compensation can never be complete. Reason: Fundamental asymmetry diff > fix.  

Consequences:  
- Space-time generates corpuscles faster or slower than they dissipate  
- System always non-equilibrium  
- Prohibition of auto-identity realized through impossibility of exact balance  
- “Arrow of time” = direction of this double flow

#### 7.7.5 Table: Two Generations and Two Directions

| Parameter | FIRST GENERATION | SECOND GENERATION |  
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|  
| Structure | Space-time | Corpuscles (masses) |  
| Formation | 1D→2D→3D evasions | Quantization, closure |  
| Dissipation direction | INWARD | OUTWARD |  
| Dissipation product | Corpuscles | Radiation, gravitational background |  
| Function in cycle | “Maternal” structure | “Daughter” structure |  
| Without second generation | Collapse inward | Impossible existence |  
| Degrees of freedom | 3 (x, y, z) | 3 + internal recursion |  

#### 7.7.6 Cosmological Consequences

1. No “heat death” in classical sense: If dissipation went only outward, all corpuscles would dissipate and universe would become pure radiation. BUT: Space-time constantly dissipates inward, generating new corpuscles. Cycle sustains itself.  
2. Why matter is stable: Corpuscles dissipate outward but form from space-time faster (or comparably fast) than they manage to dissipate. Balance: corpuscle birth ≈ their dissipation BUT: asymmetry diff > fix → never exact equality → matter exists  
3. Redshift reinterpreted: Photon = product of corpuscle dissipation outward. Its own dissipation—secondary process. z = measure of second generation dissipation outward + photon’s own dissipation  
4. Why space-time does not collapse: Corpuscle dissipation outward returns energy to space-time, preventing its complete collapse inward.

### 7.8 Two Channels of Conflict Resolution

After corpuscle formation, conflict has two paths:  
**Channel 1: Internal (discharge of difference)**  
- Conflict resolves within space-time  
- Radiation (photons)  
- Weak interaction (decay)  
- Corpuscle loses mass but remains corpuscle  

**Channel 2: External (dissipation into Monos)**  
- Conflict resolves outward—back to Monos  
- Complete opening of structure  
- Corpuscle ceases to exist  
- Process returns to free distinction  

Connection with two directions: Both channels realize corpuscle dissipation OUTWARD (second generation). Difference in degree: discharge of difference—partial opening, dissipation into Monos—complete.

### 7.9 Lifetime and Irreversibility

**Axiom 7.4 (Finiteness of Closure).** Any corpuscle has finite lifetime τ. This is ontological necessity: prohibition of auto-identity → closed structure cannot be absolutely stable → sooner or later opens.  

Dissipation formula:  
E(t) = E₀ exp(−t/τ)  

where τ—corpuscle lifetime, measure of closure “stubbornness”. Examples:  
- Photon: τ_γ ≈ 10¹⁰ years (almost not closed)  
- Proton: τ_p ≫ 10³⁴ years (maximally closed, Möbius topology)  

**Theorem 7.5 (Irreversibility of Dissipation).** Symmetry destruction is irreversible. Symmetry restoration = approach to auto-identity = forbidden. Consequently: ∆S ≥ 0 (second law of thermodynamics).

### 7.10 Cosmological Cycle

Stage 1: Monos (free distinction)  
- Tension between process and its forbidden limit  
- No space-time (no archive of evasions)  
- Pure process of auto-negation  

Stage 2: Evasion → Closure  
- 1D → 2D → 3D (dimensionality formation)  
- First generation: Space-time  
- Conflict enclosed in geometry  

Stage 3: Corpuscle Epoch (current epoch)  
- Space-time dissipates inward → corpuscle formation  
- Corpuscles dissipate outward → space-time sustenance  
- Closed dynamic non-equilibrium cycle  
- Matter exists through mutual compensation of two directions  

Stage 4: Dissipation (distant future)  
- Disruption of balance of two directions  
- Corpuscles dissipate faster than they form  
- Space-time “evaporates”  
- τ expires even for protons  

Stage 5: Return to Monos  
- All corpuscles dissipated  
- Space-time opened  
- BUT: Prohibition of auto-identity triggers  
- → New evasion → Cycle repeats  

Cycle period ≈ max(τ_corpuscles) ≈ 10³⁴+ years.

### 7.11 Symmetry Violations as Realization of Prohibition

All symmetry violations in physics—realization of auto-symmetry prohibition:  

| Phenomenon | Mechanism |  
|------------|-----------|  
| Quantization | π-fractionality |  
| P-violation | Weak interaction |  
| CP-violation | Baryonic asymmetry |  
| Arrow of time | Prohibition t ↔ −t |  
| Matter > antimatter | Prohibition of ideal symmetry |  
| Electroweak violation | Higgs mechanism |  
| Thermal fluctuations | T > 0 always |  

## 8 Part VII: Biological Interface

### 8.1 Brain as Screen

Final phase of fixation in observable Universe—Brain.  

**Definition 8.1 (Brain Function).** Brain—mechanism of temporary storage of distinctions (diff), directed toward preserving living species structure. Brain does not “create” thought. It screens external world chaos, extracting from it only those shadows (patterns) necessary for effective evasion of life from entropy.  

Consciousness—fix operation overlaid upon diff. This is moment when process begins fixing itself (reflection).

## 9 Conclusion

The work “FORCES” completes description of ontodynamic part of universe. We established that any “force” is merely name for operational regime of balance between Distinction (diff) and Fixation (fix).

### 9.1 Key Results

1. Unified theory of interactions: Four fundamental interactions reduced to operational regimes of balance diff ↔ fix  
2. Gravity reconceived: Not attraction but screening of centrifugal dissipation flow. Return to Lomonosov model on ontological foundation.  
3. Electromagnetism explained: Dynamic oscillation between distinction (electric field) and fixation (magnetic field)  
4. Weak interaction derived: Necessity of discharging excess distinction during structure stabilization  
5. Strong interaction: Linked to irrationality of π—mathematical guarantee of impossibility of ideal closure  
6. Dissipation justified: Continuous symmetry destruction as ontological necessity following from prohibition of auto-identity  
7. Two dissipation directions: Space-time dissipates inward (generating corpuscles), corpuscles dissipate outward (sustaining space-time). Closed dynamic non-equilibrium cycle.  
8. Impulse redefined: Not neutral transfer but primary dissipation form—minimal act of symmetry destruction  
9. Mass as gyroscope: Internal recursion of closed conflict, sustained discrepancy  
10. Space-time: Not container but archive of resolved evasions. Geometry of evasion from fixation limit.  
11. Prohibition of absolutes: Impossibility shown of T = 0 (ideal symmetry), S_max (complete fixation), ideal sphere (auto-identity)  
12. Cosmological cycle: Monos → Closure → Epoch of bidirectional dissipation → Balance disruption → Return to Monos. Period ≈ 10³⁴+ years.

### 9.2 Structural Completeness

Structure now fully closed:  

Verb (Monos) → Evasion from fixation limit → Recursion → Dimensionality  
↓  
FIRST GENERATION: Space-time (dissipation INWARD)  
↓  
SECOND GENERATION: Corpuscles/Mass (dissipation OUTWARD)  
↓  
Mutual compensation of two directions  
↓  
Closed dynamic non-equilibrium cycle  
↓  
Gravitational background (total dissipation outward)  
↓  
Screening → Attraction effect  

No hanging concepts. No substances. No symmetry without destruction mechanism. Two dissipation directions ensure stability without equilibrium.

### 9.3 Testable Consequences

Metamonism gives concrete predictions:  
1. Photon gravity anisotropic (directed from source)  
2. Proton has Möbius topology (maximal stability)  
3. Redshift = photon dissipation, not universe expansion  
4. No dark matter (artifact of incorrect gravity formula)  
5. No dark energy (corpuscle dissipation, not “acceleration of expansion”)  
6. Absolute zero unattainable (ontologically, not technically)  
7. All symmetry violations necessary, not random  
8. Baryonic asymmetry inevitable (ideal symmetry forbidden)  
9. Balance of corpuscle birth and dissipation determines matter density  
10. Space-time cannot collapse completely (corpuscle dissipation outward prevents collapse)

### 9.4 Philosophical Implications

The work demonstrates:  
- Primacy of process over substance: Reality—not collection of things but continuous verb  
- Grammar of physics: Physical laws—not description of “objects” but rules of diff/fix operations  
- Unity of ontology and physics: Prohibition of auto-identity (philosophical principle) generates all physical laws  
- Necessity of asymmetry: Symmetry—not ideal but threat. Reality exists through continuous symmetry destruction.  
- Cyclicity without beginning: No “Big Bang” as absolute beginning. There are phase transitions in eternal cycle.

### 9.5 Work Boundaries

Present work established first principles of processual physics but left for future investigations:  
- Precise mathematical formulations (differential geometry of operations)  
- Quantitative predictions (formulas for τ_particles, redshift)  
- Detailed corpuscle topology (quark, lepton geometry)  
- Cosmological model (cycle dynamics, phase transitions)  
- Quantum field theory in processual interpretation

### 9.6 Continuation

Next stage—investigation of how distinctions fixed in brain transform into Meanings. Work Two: “THOUGHT” If “VERB”—about grammar of being, and “FORCES”—about physics of process, then “THOUGHT” will be about how process becomes aware of itself through higher-order recursion.  

Reality is not a noun.  
Reality is a verb.  
And this verb is dissipation.
