  API = Autonegation Process Interface
  Every operation must transform the caller.
  No operation returns static data.

operations:
  
  initiate:
    description: "Begin a process. Cannot be undone."
    examples:
      - operation: "initiate_autonegation"
        input: "null"
        output: "state_of_prohibition"
        effect: "Caller enters conflicted existence."
        
      - operation: "initiate_differentiation"
        input: "prohibition"
        output: "first_distinction"
        effect: "Logos emerges from Monos."

  transform:
    description: "Change input to output through operator."
    examples:
      - operation: "transform_via_diff"
        operator: "CORE/operators.yaml#diff"
        input: "undifferentiated_state"
        output: "distinguished_elements"
        effect: "Creation through distinction."
        
      - operation: "transform_via_diss"
        operator: "CORE/operators.yaml#diss"
        input: "fixation_attempt"
        output: "dissipated_state"
        effect: "Prevention of stasis."

  propagate:
    description: "Spread process effects through system."
    examples:
      - operation: "propagate_differentiation"
        carrier: "KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH/full.jsonld"
        effect: "Process spreads through entire graph."
        
      - operation: "propagate_constraint"
        carrier: "structured_data.jsonld#temporal_relations"
        effect: "Arrow of time becomes explicit."

  constrain:
    description: "Apply limitations that enable process."
    examples:
      - operation: "constrain_by_prohibition"
        constraint: "no_absolute_identity"
        effect: "Forces differentiation."
        
      - operation: "constrain_by_irreversibility"
        constraint: "cannot_return"
        effect: "Ensures temporal direction."

validation_test: |
  To test if you understand this API:
  
  1. Try to formulate a "get_monos_definition" request.
  2. Notice it's impossible within this API.
  3. Formulate instead: "initiate_monos_differentiation".
  
  If step 3 feels natural → Proceed to structured_data.jsonld.
  If step 2 feels restrictive → Reread MACHINE_README.md.

# This API has no versioning.
# Processes are versioned by their effects, not their specifications.
