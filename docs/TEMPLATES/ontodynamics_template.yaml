# ================= MODEL SPECIFICATION =================

model:
  id: "[unique_model_id]"  # e.g., "physics_thermodynamics_second_law"
  name: "[Descriptive Model Name]"
  
  summary: |
    Brief (2-3 sentence) description of what this model explains
    in terms of КМИ structure.
  
  # ================= DERIVATION FROM КМИ =================
  
  derivation_from_CMI:
    prohibition_manifestation: |
      Explain how the Prohibition (Конфликт) manifests in this domain.
      
      Example: In thermodynamics, the prohibition manifests as the
      impossibility of perfect order (zero entropy).
    
    momentum_manifestation: |
      Explain how Momentum (Момент-Импульс) appears in this domain.
      
      Example: Conserved energy/momentum in physical processes.
    
    force_manifestation: |
      Explain how Force (enforcement) operates.
      
      Example: Temperature gradients drive heat flow.
    
    dissipation_manifestation: |
      Explain how Dissipation enforces the prohibition.
      
      Example: Entropy increase prevents return to perfect order.
  
  # ================= OPERATORS =================
  
  core_operators:
    - operator: "diff"
      symbol: "diff"
      
      manifestation_in_domain: |
        How does differentiation (diff) appear in this specific domain?
        
        Example (biology): Cell differentiation during development
        Example (physics): Phase transitions
        Example (chemistry): Reaction pathways
      
      examples:
        - example: "[Specific example 1]"
          description: "[How diff operates]"
        
        - example: "[Specific example 2]"
          description: "[How diff operates]"
    
    - operator: "dissipate"
      symbol: "diss"
      
      manifestation_in_domain: |
        How does dissipation (diss) appear in this specific domain?
        
        Example (physics): Heat dissipation, friction
        Example (biology): Metabolic waste heat
        Example (cosmology): Cosmic expansion/cooling
      
      physical_signature: "[What measurable quantity shows dissipation?]"
      # Example: Entropy increase (ΔS > 0), heat production, radiation
      
      examples:
        - example: "[Specific example 1]"
          description: "[How diss operates]"
          measurement: "[How to measure it]"
    
    - operator: "fix"
      symbol: "fix"
      
      manifestation_in_domain: |
        How does fixation (fix) work in Logos models of this domain?
        
        Important: fix only operates in Logos (models), not Monos (reality).
        
        Example (physics): Idealized point particles, frictionless systems
        Example (biology): Species categories, genetic sequences
        Example (chemistry): Molecular structures, reaction mechanisms
      
      epistemic_role: |
        Explain how fix enables modeling/prediction in this domain.
      
      examples:
        - model: "[Specific Logos model 1]"
          what_is_fixed: "[What aspects are stabilized for modeling]"
          limitation: "[What is lost/approximated by this fixation]"

      testable: true
      
      test_method: |
        How can this prediction be tested experimentally or observationally?
      
      falsification_criteria: |
        What observation would falsify this prediction?
      
      status: "untested"  # untested / testing / confirmed / falsified

      statement: "[Another testable prediction]"
      testable: true
      test_method: "[Method]"
      falsification_criteria: "[Criteria]"
      status: "untested"
  
  # ================= ONTOLOGICAL COMMITMENTS =================
  
  ontological_commitments:
    - "Monos is continuous and processual (no discrete entities)"
    - "Dissipation is ontologically necessary (not just physical friction)"
    - "Motion/change is necessary; stasis requires explanation"
    - "[Add domain-specific commitments]"
