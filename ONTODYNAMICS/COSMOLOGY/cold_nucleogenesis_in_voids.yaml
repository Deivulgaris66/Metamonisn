# ABSTRACT
# =============================================================================
abstract: |
  Cold nucleogenesis is ONGOING baryon generation in cosmic voids via
  space-time inward dissipation (first generation structure).

  The mechanism is expressed in the CORE operators:
  diss (inward discharge) and diff (particle differentiation).

  From FORCES Article Axiom 7.3: "Space-time dissipates ONLY INWARD,
  generates corpuscles through quantization."

  Section 7.7.1: "Space-time cannot dissipate 'outward'—outward would
  destroy geometry of evasion. Consequently, dissipation goes inward:
  Formation of corpuscles, Mass appearance."

  This is NOT primordial "Big Bang Nucleosynthesis" (which never occurred—
  reality is ETERNAL per eternal_dynamic_reality.yaml) but CONTINUOUS
  mechanism operating NOW.

  Observable signature: Atomic hydrogen (H I) in void centers WITHOUT
  helium (He/H < 0.01, vs BBN 0.08) and ZERO metallicity (Z ~ 0).

  DECISIVE TEST: Either voids have fresh H (Metamonism correct), or
  uniform BBN composition everywhere (Standard Model correct).

# =============================================================================
# CENTRAL PREDICTION
# =============================================================================
central_prediction:
  id: "VOID-H-NO-HE"
  short_name: "Atomic Hydrogen WITHOUT Helium in Voids"

  claim: |
    Cosmic voids contain atomic hydrogen (H I) WITHOUT accompanying helium
    (He/H << 0.08 BBN value), with zero metallicity (Z ~ 0), indicating
    cold nucleogenesis occurring NOW, not 13.8 billion years ago.

  confidence: "HIGH - decisive falsification test"

  ontological_status: "Necessary consequence of eternal dynamic reality"

  epistemological_framework:
    THAT: "Nucleogenesis MUST occur (ontological necessity from axioms)"
    WHERE: "Void centers (lowest corpuscle density)"
    WHAT: "H I with He/H < 0.01, Z ~ 0, v_r > 0"
    HOW: "UNKNOWN (internal topology revealed by observations)"

      conclusion: "Void CENTERS have maximum H generation"

      why_no_helium:
        from_article: "Simplest corpuscle = proton (first-order generation)"

        energy_argument: |
          Helium formation requires:
          - Multiple proton collisions (p + p → D + e⁺ + ν)
          - Deuterium fusion (D + p → ³He + γ)
          - Final fusion (³He + ³He → ⁴He + 2p)

          At T ~ 10-100 K (cold voids): Insufficient kinetic energy
          for Coulomb barrier penetration.

          Therefore: Protons accumulate WITHOUT fusing to He.

# FALSIFICATION CRITERIA
# =============================================================================
falsification_criteria:
  metamonism_FALSIFIED_if:
    condition_1:
      observable: "NO H I detected in void centers"
      threshold: "All surveys: N(H I) < 10^17 cm^-2 (10+ voids surveyed)"
      implication: "Inward dissipation does NOT generate baryons at detectable rate"

    condition_2:
      observable: "ALL void gas has He/H = 0.08"
      threshold: "He/H = 0.08 ± 0.01 everywhere (no spatial variation)"
      implication: "BBN composition is universal (no fresh H generation)"

    condition_3:
      observable: "Significant metallicity everywhere"
      threshold: "Z > 0.01 Z_solar in all void regions"
      implication: "All gas has been processed by stars (no pristine gas)"

    condition_4:
      observable: "NO spatial gradient"
      threshold: "He/H(r) and Z(r) flat (no radial dependence)"
      implication: "No birth site at void center (uniform composition)"

    combined: |
      If ALL four conditions met → cold nucleogenesis FALSIFIED

      Metamonism response:
      - Core axioms (ban_of_absolute_identity) remain valid
      - Two-generation model structure intact
      - Requires alternative baryon birth mechanism
      - OR: dissipation rate too slow for current detection

  metamonism_SUPPORTED_if:
    condition_1:
      observable: "H I detected in ≥3 void centers"
      threshold: "N(H I) > 10^19 cm^-2"

    condition_2:
      observable: "He/H anomalously low"
      threshold: "He/H < 0.05 in void centers (≥3σ below BBN)"

    condition_3:
      observable: "Zero metallicity"
      threshold: "Z < 10^-3 Z_solar ([Fe/H] < -3)"

    condition_4:
      observable: "Radial gradient exists"
      threshold: "He/H(r) increases by ≥factor 2 from center to edge"

    combined: |
      If ANY TWO conditions met → cold nucleogenesis SUPPORTED
      If ALL FOUR conditions met → cold nucleogenesis CONFIRMED

      Implications:
      - BBN FALSIFIED (He/H not universal)
      - Big Bang model CHALLENGED (nucleogenesis ongoing)
      - Eternal reality model VALIDATED

  standard_BBN_FALSIFIED_if:
    condition: "He/H significantly below 0.08 in ANY region"
    threshold: "He/H < 0.05 (≥3σ significance)"

    implication: |
      BBN claims:
      - All baryons created at t=3 min (T ~ 10^9 K)
      - He/H = 0.08 everywhere (primordial, uniform)

      If He/H < 0.05 anywhere:
      - BBN prediction WRONG
      - Alternative nucleogenesis exists
      - Standard cosmology requires revision

        Measure He/H in single void center.

        IF He/H = 0.08 → BBN correct, Metamonism wrong

# NOTES
# =============================================================================
notes: |
  This file specifies the PRIMARY observational prediction of cold
  nucleogenesis, derived necessarily from eternal_dynamic_reality.yaml.

  Key points:
  1. NOT hypothesis but NECESSITY (follows from axioms)
  2. Decisive test (He/H in voids: < 0.01 vs 0.08)
  3. Observable NOW with existing instruments (SKA, Keck/VLT)
  4. Falsifiable (clear criteria for rejection)

  Epistemology:
  - THAT it happens: DEDUCTIVE (from axioms)
  - WHERE to look: PREDICTIVE (voids)
  - WHAT to see: SPECIFIC (He/H < 0.01, Z ~ 0)
  - HOW internally: EMPIRICAL (topology from observations)

  This is the "smoking gun" test for Metamonism cosmology.
  Either voids have fresh H, or they don't. No ambiguity.
