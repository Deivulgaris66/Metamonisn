  description: "TODO: Explanation of cosmic web (filaments, voids, clusters) through patterns in the fundamental ontological field."
  core_concepts: ["diff"]
  status: "hypothesis"

# TODO: Formalize the model.
model:
  premise: "TODO: The primordial state is not a singularity, but a dynamic, inhomogeneous field of diff."
  structure_formation: "TODO: Filaments and voids are not gravitational collapses in an expanding space, but persistent patterns ('attractors' and 'repellers') in the topology of the diff process."
  role_of_gravity: "TODO: Gravity, interpreted as shielding (see PHYSICS/gravity.yaml), acts as a secondary process that enhances and makes visible these pre-existing ontological structures."

# TODO: List predictions about structure that differ from standard inflationary cosmology.
predictions:
  - id: "pred_structure_1"
    statement: "TODO: The statistical distribution of void sizes and shapes should show signatures of a non-random, topological origin."
    testability: "TODO: Comparison of void catalogs from simulations with observational data (e.g., SDSS)."
