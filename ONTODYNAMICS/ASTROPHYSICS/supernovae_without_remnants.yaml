# ABSTRACT
# =============================================================================
abstract: |
  Baryon death occurs via AVALANCHE CHAIN REACTION: baryons of similar age
  reach dissipation threshold simultaneously → first unlocking triggers
  cascade → explosive mass disintegration.
  
  CRITICAL CONTEXT (from gas_and_galaxy_dynamics_cycle.yaml):
  Old elliptical galaxies in cluster cores are INEVITABLE ENDPOINT of
  baryon lifecycle:
  - Voids → fresh H birth
  - Filament edges → galaxies gain mass
  - Infall to cores → quenching, low diff environment
  - Cores → isolated WDs reach threshold → THIS ARTICLE
  
  EXPLOSION PHYSICS (DIFFERENT from standard SN):
  - NOT thermonuclear (no core bounce)
  - BUT avalanche axis unlocking (chain reaction)
  - Baryons of same age → threshold reached together
  - First unlocking → triggers neighbors → cascade
  
  PRODUCTS:
  - High-energy γ-quanta (>GeV, from massive baryon structure)
  - NOT fusion products (nuclei destroyed, not fused)
  - NO radioactive decay chain (no ⁵⁶Ni → no afterglow)
  - NO remnant (100% energy release, nothing left)
  
  Observable: Fast transients in cluster core ellipticals, prompt hard
  gammas, no afterglow, no remnant.

notes: |
  VERSION 2.0 CHANGES (complete rewrite):
  
  1. Added CRITICAL CONTEXT from gas_and_galaxy_dynamics_cycle.yaml
     → Now self-evident WHY old cluster core galaxies
     
  2. Corrected EXPLOSION PHYSICS:
     - NOT thermonuclear (no core bounce)
     - BUT avalanche chain reaction (baryons same age → cascade)
     
  3. Corrected PRODUCTS:
     - NOT regular photons BUT high-energy γ-quanta (>GeV)
     - Reason: Two locked axes contain baryon-scale energy
     
  4. Corrected AFTERGLOW:
     - NO nuclear fusion (nuclei destroyed, not fused)
     - NO ⁵⁶Ni production → NO radioactive decay → NO afterglow
     
  5. Added PROMPT HARD GAMMAS as key signature
     - Distinguishes from standard (delayed MeV)
     - Validates baryon-scale energy release
     
  This is now COMPLETE description of baryon death mechanism
  with correct physics and clear observational tests.
  
  Epistemology:
  - THAT it happens: DEDUCTIVE (from axioms + cycle necessity)
  - WHERE it happens: PREDICTIVE (cluster cores, explained by dynamics)
  - WHAT to see: SPECIFIC (fast transient, GeV gammas, no remnant)
  - HOW internally: PARTIALLY KNOWN (avalanche) + EMPIRICAL (which axis? dynamics?)
