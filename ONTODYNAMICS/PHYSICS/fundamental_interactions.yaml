# ================= MODEL SPECIFICATION =================

model:
  id: "physics_fundamental_interactions_dissipative_unification"
  name: "Unification of Four Fundamental Interactions as Regimes of Dissipative Process"
  
  summary: |
    The four fundamental interactions (gravity, electromagnetism, weak, strong) 
    are not separate forces but different geometric regimes of a single 
    ontological process: the dissipation of actualization flux through 
    autonegation. Each interaction emerges from specific topological 
    configurations in the dissipative flow.

  # ================= DERIVATION FROM CMI =================
  
  derivation_from_CMI:
    prohibition_manifestation: |
      The Prohibition manifests as the impossibility of absolute stasis 
      or perfect identity. All configurations must dissipate, creating 
      the necessity for continuous actualization through topological 
      restructuring.
    
    momentum_manifestation: |
      Momentum appears as the conservation of dissipative capacity 
      through topological transitions. The actualization flux maintains 
      continuity across configuration changes, manifesting as energy-momentum 
      conservation in effective descriptions.
    
    force_manifestation: |
      Force operates as the gradient in dissipative flux density. 
      Different force types correspond to different geometric regimes 
      of flux distribution: screening (gravity), projection (EM), 
      reconfiguration (weak), and stabilization (strong).
    
    dissipation_manifestation: |
      Dissipation enforces the prohibition by requiring all nodes 
      (stabilized configurations) to continuously actualize through 
      flux redistribution. This manifests as the universal tendency 
      toward equilibrium in all interaction regimes.
  
  # ================= OPERATORS =================
  
  core_operators:
    - operator: "diff"
      symbol: "diff"
      
      manifestation_in_domain: |
        Differentiation appears as the formation of distinct topological 
        configurations (nodes) from the continuous dissipative flux. 
        This includes:
        1. Node formation from critical causal density
        2. Differentiation of operator configurations (d-u patterns)
        3. Separation into distinct interaction regimes
        4. Particle generation as topological restructuring events
      
      examples:
        - example: "Neutron/proton differentiation"
          description: "Formation of distinct topological configurations (d-u-d vs u-d-u) from same dissipative process"
        
        - example: "Interaction regime differentiation"
          description: "Emergence of four distinct force behaviors from single dissipative mechanics"
    
    - operator: "dissipate"
      symbol: "diss"
      
      manifestation_in_domain: |
        Dissipation appears as the continuous redistribution of 
        actualization flux through:
        1. Global centripetal flux (background spacetime)
        2. Centrifugal projection from nodes (EM charge)
        3. Topological reconfiguration events (weak decays)
        4. Coherence maintenance flows (strong force)
      
      physical_signature: "Entropy increase, radiation, thermalization, interaction cross-sections"
      
      examples:
        - example: "Gravitational screening"
          description: "Passive dissipation deficit between nodes creates attractive gradient"
          measurement: "Gravitational constant G, deflection of light, time dilation"
        
        - example: "Beta decay"
          description: "Topological inversion dissipating excess causal density"
          measurement: "Decay rates, energy spectra, parity violation"
    
    - operator: "fix"
      symbol: "fix"
      
      manifestation_in_domain: |
        Fixation operates in Logos models that idealize the continuous 
        dissipative process as discrete entities and forces. Standard 
        physics models fix aspects of Monos to enable prediction:
        
        1. Particles as fixed entities rather than topological processes
        2. Forces as separate interactions rather than regime distinctions
        3. Spacetime as container rather than emergent geometry
        4. Conservation laws as absolute rather than topological constraints
      
      epistemic_role: |
        Fix enables mathematical modeling by stabilizing continuous 
        processes into discrete categories (particles, fields, symmetries). 
        This allows precise predictions but obscures ontological continuity.
      
      examples:
        - model: "Standard Model of particle physics"
          what_is_fixed: "Particle identities, force carriers, gauge symmetries"
          limitation: "Treats interactions as separate ontological categories"
        
        - model: "General Relativity"
          what_is_fixed: "Spacetime manifold, metric tensor, energy-momentum"
          limitation: "Treats curvature as primitive rather than emergent from screening"
  
  # ================= PREDICTIONS =================
  
  predictions:
    - id: "prediction_cosmological_nucleogenesis"
      statement: "Continuous neutron formation occurs in cosmic voids via cold topological processes, producing anomalous D/H ratios without corresponding He production"
      
      testable: true
      
      test_method: |
        Quasar absorption spectra probing cosmic voids should show:
        1. D/H ratios significantly above standard BBN prediction (2.5×10⁻⁵)
        2. Deficit or absence of He compared to standard nucleosynthesis
        3. Specific redshift dependence correlated with void properties
      
      falsification_criteria: |
        Measurement of standard BBN abundances (D/H ≈ 2.5×10⁻⁵, He/H ≈ 0.08) 
        in pristine voids would falsify the dissipative mechanism.
      
      status: "untested"
    
    - id: "prediction_weak_structure"
      statement: "Weak interaction deviations from Standard Model predictions at extreme energies where topological discreteness becomes apparent"
      
      testable: true
      test_method: |
        High-energy collider experiments (beyond current LHC energies) 
        probing sub-nodal structure should show:
        1. Deviations in weak cross-section energy dependence
        2. Anomalous event topologies in weak decay processes
        3. Energy thresholds where boson exchange approximation breaks down
      
      falsification_criteria: |
        Exact agreement with Standard Model predictions at all experimentally 
        accessible energies would support particle-mediated view over topological.
      
      status: "untested"
    
    - id: "prediction_gravitational_anomalies"
      statement: "Non-GR gravitational effects in extreme-density regimes where screening becomes nonlinear"
      
      testable: true
      test_method: |
        Observations of neutron stars, black hole candidates, and 
        extreme astrophysical systems should reveal:
        1. Mass-radius relations deviating from GR predictions
        2. Gravitational wave signatures with additional polarization modes
        3. Anomalous lensing in strong-field regimes
      
      falsification_criteria: |
        Perfect agreement with GR predictions in all strong-field 
        observations would support curvature primacy over screening.
      
      status: "untested"
  
  # ================= ONTOLOGICAL COMMITMENTS =================
  
  ontological_commitments:
    - "Monos is continuous and processual - particles are topological nodes in dissipative flow"
    - "Dissipation is ontologically necessary - all interactions arise from flux redistribution"
    - "Force unification is ontological, not just mathematical - one process, four regimes"
    - "Spacetime is emergent geometry of global dissipative flow"
    - "Symmetries are effective descriptions of topological conservation laws"
    - "Range and strength hierarchies derive from functional roles in dissipative mechanics"
  
  # ================= LOGOS MODELS =================
  
  logos_models:
    - model_name: "General Relativity"
      
      description: |
        Mathematical description of gravity as spacetime curvature 
        determined by energy-momentum distribution.
      
      what_is_fixed: |
        1. Spacetime as Riemannian manifold
        2. Metric tensor as fundamental field
        3. Energy-momentum as source term
        4. Einstein field equations as governing law
      
      idealizations:
        - "Treats curvature as primitive rather than emergent"
        - "Assumes continuum physics at all scales"
        - "Separates gravity from other interactions ontologically"
      
      limitations: |
        Does not capture the dissipative screening mechanism that 
        generates curvature. Treats symptom rather than process.
      
      accuracy_domain: |
        Accurate for all experimental tests to date, but likely 
        breaks down at Planck scale and extreme densities where 
        screening mechanics become nonlinear.
    
    - model_name: "Standard Model Gauge Theories"
      
      description: |
        Quantum field theories with U(1)×SU(2)×SU(3) symmetries 
        describing electromagnetic, weak, and strong interactions.
      
      what_is_fixed: |
        1. Particles as discrete quantum fields
        2. Forces as gauge boson exchanges
        3. Symmetries as fundamental principles
        4. Lagrangians with fixed coupling constants
      
      idealizations:
        - "Treats interactions as separate ontological categories"
        - "Assumes particle-mediated force transmission"
        - "Requires ad hoc symmetry breaking mechanisms"
      
      limitations: |
        Does not explain why these particular symmetries, why the 
        hierarchy of strengths, or why the specific phenomenology 
        (parity violation, asymptotic freedom). Treats patterns 
        without revealing generating process.
      
      accuracy_domain: |
        Extraordinarily accurate for all collider physics to date, 
        but mathematical rather than ontological unification.
  
  # ================= ISOMORPHISMS =================
  
  isomorphisms_to_other_domains:
    - domain: "Thermodynamics"
      model: "Dissipative structures (Prigogine)"
      
      structural_similarity: |
        Both describe how organization emerges from nonequilibrium 
        processes through continuous energy/matter flow. Just as 
        dissipative structures maintain organization through 
        entropy export, particles maintain identity through 
        actualization flux dissipation.
      
      shared_pattern: |
        "Order through dissipation" - stable configurations 
        maintained by continuous process rather than static 
        equilibrium.
    
    - domain: "Neuroscience"
      model: "Predictive coding/Free energy principle"
      
      structural_similarity: |
        Both involve hierarchical prediction-error minimization 
        through dissipative flows. In predictive coding, perception 
        minimizes prediction error; in particle physics, interactions 
        minimize dissipative flux gradients.
      
      shared_pattern: |
        Gradient descent in some potential - whether information 
        theoretic (surprise) or physical (actualization flux).

# ================= NOTES =================

notes: |
  Key distinctions from standard approaches:
  
  1. Gravity is screening deficit, not curvature primacy
  2. Weak interaction is topological event, not boson exchange
  3. Strong interaction is coherence maintenance, not color force
  4. All interactions are geometric regimes of one process
  
  Mathematical formalization needed:
  - Derivation of effective field equations from dissipative dynamics
  - Quantitative prediction of coupling constants
  - Recovery of Standard Model and GR in appropriate limits
  
  Testable predictions distinguish this from standard theory:
  - Cosmological nucleogenesis signature
  - Weak interaction high-energy deviations
  - Gravitational anomalies in extreme densities
