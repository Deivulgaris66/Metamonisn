## Abstract

We propose an ontological reinterpretation of the quantum measurement problem using a process-based framework. The photon is not treated as a particle or wave, but as a metastable process capable of transforming into multiple physical forms such as thermal, electrical, chemical, or mechanical effects.

The double-slit experiment is reinterpreted as a spatially distributed process whose transformation is either deferred to the detection screen or forced earlier by measurement near the slits. Interference arises not from wave behavior but from delayed transformation.

Measurement corresponds to an ontological phase transition of the process rather than to information acquisition or wavefunction collapse. The framework does not replace the standard quantum formalism but offers an alternative ontological interpretation. Formally, it is expressed through primitive processual operators of differentiation, fixation, and dissipation (diff / fix / diss), rather than as a predictive mathematical formalism.

## 1. Introduction

Quantum mechanics remains operationally successful yet ontologically opaque. Central paradoxes such as wave–particle duality, superposition, and the measurement problem arise from treating quantum entities as objects rather than processes. The double-slit experiment with single photons exemplifies this tension.

Standard interpretations invoke wavefunction collapse, observer effects, or many-worlds branching. Here, an alternative grounded in process ontology is proposed: quantum entities are not objects that change state but processes that transform form.

The present framework resonates with broader process-oriented approaches in the philosophy of physics, including Alfred North Whitehead’s process metaphysics and David Bohm’s later ideas of an implicate, holistically unfolding order. No formal dependence on these frameworks is assumed.

---

## 2. Photon as Transformable Process

A photon is defined as a propagating process carrying the capacity for transformation. It is not intrinsically a particle or a wave. Its empirical manifestations are outcomes of where and how this process transforms.

A photon always terminates in a transformation:

- thermal excitation (heat)  
- electrical current (photoelectric effect)  
- chemical reaction (photochemistry)  
- atomic excitation  

The relevant question is not whether transformation occurs, but where.

---

## 3. Double-Slit Experiment Without Measurement

When a photon passes through a double-slit apparatus without detectors at the slits, no transformation occurs there. The process remains spatially distributed relative to the slit geometry.

Interference observed on the detection screen reflects the spatial constraints imposed on the process prior to transformation. The screen is the first location where the process is forced to transform, producing localized outcomes.

No wave ontology is required. The interference pattern encodes constraints on a distributed process rather than oscillations of a physical wave.

---

## 4. Measurement as Early Transformation

When detectors are placed near the slits, the photon process is forced into interaction with the measuring apparatus, resulting in early transformation:

- energy transfer to the detector  
- localized interaction  
- irreversible coupling  

This premature transformation prevents the maintenance of a distributed configuration. Interference disappears due to physical reconfiguration of the process, not due to observer knowledge.

Measurement is therefore ontological rather than epistemic.

---

## 5. Ontological Phase Transition

Measurement is characterized as an ontological phase transition:

- Pre-measurement: distributed propagation  
- Measurement: forced localized interaction  
- Post-measurement: completed classical transformation  

No collapse occurs. The process ceases to exist in its prior form.

---

## 6. Formal Ontological Description via diff / fix / diss

The framework employs three primitive ontological operators:

- diff — differentiation  
- fix — fixation  
- diss — dissipation  

These operators describe processual transitions rather than mathematical functions.

### 6.1 Photon as Process Configuration

Let \( P \) denote a photon process.

$$
P(t) = diss \circ diff(M)
$$

Here \( M \) denotes an intentionally primitive processual substrate.

In the absence of measurement:

$$
fix(P) = \varnothing
$$

The process remains delocalized.

---

### 6.2 Double-Slit Without Measurement

Passing through a double-slit apparatus \( S = \{s_1, s_2\} \):

$$
diff(P, S) \rightarrow P_{distributed}
$$

No which-path distinction is fixed.

---

### 6.3 Detection Screen as Fixation Boundary

At the detection screen \( D \):

$$
fix(P, D) \rightarrow T_i
$$

followed by dissipation:

$$
diss(fix(P)) \rightarrow T_i
$$

Here \( T_i \) denotes an irreversible classical transformation.

---

### 6.4 Measurement Near the Slits

Introducing a detector near slit \( s_k \):

$$
fix(P, s_k) \rightarrow T_k
$$

This destroys the distributed configuration:

$$
\neg diff(P, S)
$$

---

### 6.5 Measurement as Phase Transition

Measurement is summarized as:

$$
Measurement := fix \circ diss \circ diff
$$

applied at a specific boundary.

---

## 7. Implications and Extensions

### 7.1 Decoherence as Gradual Fixation

Environmental decoherence corresponds to partial fixation:

$$
fix_\varepsilon(P), \quad 0 < \varepsilon < 1
$$

Interference degrades continuously with coupling strength.

---

### 7.2 Quantum Erasers Reinterpreted

If dissipation has not occurred, fixation may be reversed, restoring distributed configurations and allowing interference to re-emerge.

---

### 7.3 Testable Interpretation

The framework does not add new empirical predictions. Instead, it offers an ontologically economical reinterpretation of known decoherence phenomena.

---

## 8. Conclusion

Quantum paradoxes arise from treating processes as objects. By redefining the photon as a transformable process and measurement as an ontological phase transition, the central mysteries of quantum mechanics are reframed rather than mathematically replaced.

The framework introduces no new empirical predictions. Its contribution lies in ontological economy: paradoxes dissolve when object-based metaphysics is replaced by a processual account. Measurement becomes a localized acceleration of an otherwise inevitable transformation.
