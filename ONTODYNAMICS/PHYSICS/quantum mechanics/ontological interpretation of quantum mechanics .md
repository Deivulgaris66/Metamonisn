## Abstract

We propose an ontological reinterpretation of the quantum measurement problem using a process-based framework. The photon is not treated as a particle or wave, but as a metastable process capable of transforming into multiple physical forms (thermal, electrical, chemical, or mechanical). The double-slit experiment is reinterpreted as a spatially distributed process whose transformation is either deferred to the detection screen or forced earlier by measurement near the slits. Interference arises not from wave behavior but from delayed transformation. Measurement corresponds to an ontological phase transition of the process, not to information acquisition or wavefunction collapse.

It does not replace the standard quantum formalism, but offers an alternative ontological interpretation of it. Formally, this framework is expressed as a formal ontological schema articulated via primitive processual operators of differentiation, fixation, and dissipation (`diff / fix / diss`), rather than as a predictive mathematical formalism. This approach reframes the ontological basis of the measurement problem, eliminates observer-dependence, and aligns quantum phenomena with general principles of dissipative process ontology.

## 1. Introduction

Quantum mechanics remains operationally successful yet ontologically opaque. Central paradoxes—wave–particle duality, superposition, and the measurement problem—arise from treating quantum entities as objects rather than processes. The double-slit experiment with single photons exemplifies this tension: photons produce interference patterns when unobserved but behave as localized events when measured.

Standard interpretations invoke wavefunction collapse, observer effects, or many-worlds branching. We propose an alternative grounded in process ontology: quantum entities are not objects that change state, but processes that transform form.

The present framework resonates with broader process-oriented approaches in the philosophy of physics, including Alfred North Whitehead’s process metaphysics and David Bohm’s later ideas of an implicate, holistically unfolding order. While no formal dependence on these frameworks is assumed, the present work shares the central intuition that quantum phenomena arise from underlying processual dynamics rather than from fundamentally object-like entities.

## 2. Photon as Transformable Process

A photon is defined here as a propagating process that carries the capacity for transformation. It is not intrinsically a particle or a wave. Its empirical manifestations—localized detection events, energy transfer, or interference patterns—are outcomes of where and how this process transforms.

Crucially, a photon always ends as a transformation:

- thermal excitation (heat)  
- electrical current (photoelectric effect)  
- chemical reaction (photochemistry)  
- atomic excitation  

The question is not **whether** transformation occurs, but **where**.

---

## 3. Double-Slit Experiment Without Measurement

When a photon passes through a double-slit apparatus without detectors at the slits, no transformation occurs there. The process remains spatially distributed and delocalized with respect to the slit geometry. It is not committed to a localized interaction.

Interference observed on the detection screen reflects the geometry of the process’s propagation prior to transformation. The screen is the first location where the process is forced to transform, producing a localized event. The interference pattern emerges statistically from many such deferred transformations.

No assumption of wave ontology is required. The interference pattern encodes the spatial constraints of the apparatus on a distributed process, not oscillations of a physical wave.

---

## 4. Measurement as Early Transformation

When detectors are placed near the slits, the situation changes fundamentally. The photon process is forced to interact with the measuring apparatus, resulting in an early transformation:

- energy transfer to the detector  
- localized interaction  
- irreversible coupling  

This transformation near the slit prevents the process from maintaining its distributed form. Consequently, the conditions required for interference no longer exist. The disappearance of interference is not due to knowledge acquisition or observer awareness, but to a physical reconfiguration of the process.

Measurement is therefore not epistemic but ontological: it relocates the transformation event.

---

## 5. Ontological Phase Transition

Measurement is characterized as an ontological phase transition of a process:

- **Pre-measurement:** distributed, delocalized, non-transformative propagation  
- **Measurement:** forced transition into a locally interacting form  
- **Post-measurement:** completed transformation into classical effects  

This transition is analogous to a phase change rather than a state update. No collapse occurs; the process simply ceases to exist in its prior form.

## 6. Formal Ontological Description via diff / fix / diss

The framework is expressed using three primitive ontological operators: `diff`, `fix`, and `diss`. These are not mathematical functions but processual operations.

### 6.1 Photon as Process Configuration

Let \( P \) denote a photon process in **Monos**. Its propagation is described as:

\[
P(t) = diss \circ diff (M)
\]

where \( M \) is an underlying processual substrate, intentionally left primitive.

In the absence of measurement:

\[
fix(P) = \varnothing
\]

The process remains delocalized and non-objectifiable.

### 6.2 Double-Slit Without Measurement

Passing through a double slit \( S = \{s_1, s_2\} \):

\[
diff(P, S) \rightarrow P_{distributed}
\]

No which-path distinction is fixed. Interference emerges from deferred fixation.

### 6.3 Detection Screen as Fixation Boundary

At the detection screen \( D \):

\[
fix(P, D) \rightarrow T_i
\]

followed by:

\[
diss(fix(P)) \rightarrow \text{irreversible transformation}
\]

### 6.4 Measurement Near the Slits

Introducing a detector near slit \( s_k \):

\[
fix(P, s_k) \rightarrow T_k
\]

This destroys the distributed configuration:

\[
\neg diff(P, S)
\]

### 6.5 Measurement as Phase Transition

\[
\text{Measurement} := fix \circ diss \circ diff
\]

applied at a specific boundary.

---

## 7. Implications and Extensions

### 7.1 Decoherence as Gradual Fixation

Environmental decoherence is interpreted as partial fixation:

\[
fix_\varepsilon(P), \quad 0 < \varepsilon < 1
\]

leading to gradual degradation of interference.

### 7.2 Quantum Erasers Reinterpreted

If dissipation has not occurred, fixation can be undone, restoring conditions for a distributed configuration and interference.

### 7.3 Testable Predictions

The framework reinterprets known decoherence results in ontological terms and motivates experiments with controllable partial-transformation zones.

---

## 8. Conclusion

Quantum paradoxes arise from treating processes as objects. By redefining the photon as a transformable process and measurement as an ontological phase transition, the central mysteries of quantum mechanics are ontologically reframed rather than mathematically replaced.

The framework introduces no new empirical predictions but offers ontological economy. By abandoning object-based metaphysics in favor of a processual account, familiar paradoxes dissolve without observer mystification or hidden variables. Measurement becomes a localized acceleration of an otherwise inevitable transformation.
