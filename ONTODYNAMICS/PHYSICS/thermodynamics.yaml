  title: "Thermodynamics Interpretation"
  description: "TODO: Interpretation of entropy, arrow of time, and irreversibility through the diff operator."
  core_concepts: ["diff"]

# TODO: Formalize the interpretation.
interpretation:
  entropy:
    description: "TODO: Entropy increase is the macroscopic manifestation of the continuous, irreversible diff process at the ontological foundation."
  arrow_of_time:
    description: "TODO: The thermodynamic arrow of time is aligned with the fundamental directionality of the diff operation."
  reversibility_paradox:
    description: "TODO: Apparent reversibility in microscopic equations is an idealization within Logos, neglecting the ontological primacy of diff."

# TODO: List implications or novel viewpoints.
implications:
  - statement: "TODO: An implication for the end-state (heat death) of the universe."
