  title: "Quantum Mechanics Interpretation"
  description: "TODO: Re-description of quantum superposition, measurement, and non-locality using diff/fix operators."
  core_concepts: ["diff", "fix"]

# TODO: Formalize the interpretation.
interpretation:
  superposition:
    description: "TODO: A quantum superposition is a state of maximal potential distinction (high diff) before a specific fixation (fix) occurs."
    relates_to_axiom: "axiom_indifference_ban" # From CORE/axioms.yaml
  collapse:
    description: "TODO: Wavefunction collapse is the ontological necessity of a fix operation, prohibiting a state of pure potential (indifference)."
  entanglement:
    description: "TODO: Non-local correlations arise from a shared diff context that precedes spatially separated fix events."

# TODO: List falsifiable predictions or differences from standard interpretations.
predictions:
  - statement: "TODO: A prediction about measurement outcomes under specific diff/fix constraints."
    testability: "TODO: Describe an experimental setup."
