# Metamonism Project: Ontological Framework (Version 1.0)

## Status
**Framework Version:** 1.0 (Initial Release)  
**Specification Status:** Stable  
**License:** Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)  
**Ontology Steward:** Andrii Myshko (Metamonist)

## Purpose
Metamonism is **not a scientific theory**. It is a minimalistic **ontological framework** that provides foundational constraints for building consistent interdisciplinary models. It addresses the problem of conceptual fragmentation across scientific disciplines (physics, biology, cognitive science, sociology) by establishing a common ontological protocol.

## Core: The Indifference Ban Axiom
> **Absolute identity (a state without distinctions) is ontologically impossible.**

Reality is described as a fundamental process of differentiation (`diff`) and actualization (`fix`). All derivative models and theories must be compatible with this basic constraint.

## Key Features
- **Machine-First Design:** All specifications in structured formats (YAML, JSON-LD).
- **Versioned Ontology:** Clear tracking of concept evolution through `CHANGELOG`.
- **Interdisciplinary Bridges:** Explicit isomorphisms between knowledge domains.
- **Falsifiability through Extensions:** Testable predictions are formulated in applied theories, not in the core.

## Getting Started
- **👨‍🔬 For Researchers & Philosophers:** Explore the [human-readable articles (H-versions)](#) (links to be added in ARTICLES/).
- **🤖 For Developers, AI & Data Analysis:** Explore the [machine-readable specifications (M-versions)](./ONTODYNAMICS/). This is the primary interface for programmatic use of the framework.
- **🧩 For Contributors:** Please review [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
